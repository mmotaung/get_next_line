Book 01	Genesis

001:001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
        upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
        the face of the waters.

001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

001:004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
        light from the darkness.

001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
        Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
        waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
        under the firmament from the waters which were above the
        firmament: and it was so.

001:008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
        morning were the second day.

001:009 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
        together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it
        was so.

001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
        of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
        yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
        kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

001:012 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
        after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in
        itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

001:014 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
        heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
        signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
        give light upon the earth: and it was so.

001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
        day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars
        also.

001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
        upon the earth,

001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the
        light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
        creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth
        in the open firmament of heaven.

001:021 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
        moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their
        kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that
        it was good.

001:022 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
        fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the
        earth.

001:023 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

001:024 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
        after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the
        earth after his kind: and it was so.

001:025 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
        after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth
        after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

001:026 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
        likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
        and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
        all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
        upon the earth.

001:027 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
        created he him; male and female created he them.

001:028 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
        multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
        dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
        air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

001:029 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
        seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,
        in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it
        shall be for meat.

001:030 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
        and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
        is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was
        so.

001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
        very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
        of them.

002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
        and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
        had made.

002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
        that in it he had rested from all his work which God created
        and made.

002:004 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
        they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth
        and the heavens,

002:005 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
        every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had
        not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man
        to till the ground.

002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
        face of the ground.

002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
        breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
        a living soul.

002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there
        he put the man whom he had formed.

002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
        that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
        life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
        knowledge of good and evil.

002:010 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from
        thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth
        the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the
        onyx stone.

002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
        compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

002:014 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
        goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is
        Euphrates.

002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
        Eden to dress it and to keep it.

002:016 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of
        the garden thou mayest freely eat:

002:017 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
        not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
        shalt surely die.

002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
        alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
        field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam
        to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
        every living creature, that was the name thereof.

002:020 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
        and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not
        found an help meet for him.

002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
        slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
        instead thereof;

002:022 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
        woman, and brought her unto the man.

002:023 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
        flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
        Man.

002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
        shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
        ashamed.

003:001 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
        which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
        hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
        of the trees of the garden:

003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
        garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
        ye touch it, lest ye die.

003:004 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

003:005 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
        eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
        and evil.

003:006 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
        that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
        make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and
        gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

003:007 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
        were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
        themselves aprons.

003:008 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden
        in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves
        from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the
        garden.

003:009 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
        art thou?

003:010 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
        afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

003:011 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou
        eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou
        shouldest not eat?

003:012 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,
        she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

003:013 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
        hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
        did eat.

003:014 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
        this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast
        of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
        thou eat all the days of thy life:

003:015 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
        thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
        shalt bruise his heel.

003:016 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
        thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and
        thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
        thee.

003:017 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
        voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I
        commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is
        the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
        the days of thy life;

003:018 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and
        thou shalt eat the herb of the field;

003:019 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
        return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
        dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

003:020 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the
        mother of all living.

003:021 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
        skins, and clothed them.

003:022 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,
        to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand,
        and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

003:023 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
        to till the ground from whence he was taken.

003:024 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
        garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned
        every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

004:001 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,
        and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

004:002 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
        sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

004:003 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of
        the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

004:004 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and
        of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to
        his offering:

004:005 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain
        was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

004:006 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is
        thy countenance fallen?

004:007 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou
        doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be
        his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

004:008 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,
        when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel
        his brother, and slew him.

004:009 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
        said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

004:010 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's
        blood crieth unto me from the ground.

004:011 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
        mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

004:012 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield
        unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou
        be in the earth.

004:013 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I
        can bear.

004:014 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
        earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a
        fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to
        pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.

004:015 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
        vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a
        mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

004:016 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in
        the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

004:017 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and
        he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the
        name of his son, Enoch.

004:018 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
        Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

004:019 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was
        Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

004:020 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in
        tents, and of such as have cattle.

004:021 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all
        such as handle the harp and organ.

004:022 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every
        artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was
        Naamah.

004:023 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my
        voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have
        slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

004:024 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
        sevenfold.

004:025 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called
        his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another
        seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

004:026 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called
        his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the
        LORD.

005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that
        God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;

005:002 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called
        their name Adam, in the day when they were created.

005:003 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in
        his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name
        Seth:

005:004 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight
        hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:

005:005 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty
        years: and he died.

005:006 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:

005:007 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven
        years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:008 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years:
        and he died.

005:009 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:

005:010 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen
        years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:011 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and
        he died.

005:012 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:

005:013 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and
        forty years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:014 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years:
        and he died.

005:015 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:

005:016 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and
        thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:017 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and
        five years: and he died.

005:018 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat
        Enoch:

005:019 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and
        begat sons and daughters:

005:020 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two
        years: and he died.

005:021 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:

005:022 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three
        hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:023 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five
        years:

005:024 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.

005:025 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and
        begat Lamech.

005:026 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred
        eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:027 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and
        nine years: and he died.

005:028 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a
        son:

005:029 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort
        us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the
        ground which the LORD hath cursed.

005:030 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and
        five years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:031 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and
        seven years: and he died.

005:032 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,
        and Japheth.

006:001 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of
        the earth, and daughters were born unto them,

006:002 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
        fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

006:003 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,
        for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred
        and twenty years.

006:004 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after
        that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men,
        and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men
        which were of old, men of renown.

006:005 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
        and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was
        only evil continually.

006:006 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth,
        and it grieved him at his heart.

006:007 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from
        the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping
        thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I
        have made them.

006:008 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

006:009 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and
        perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.

006:010 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

006:011 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was
        filled with violence.

006:012 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt;
        for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

006:013 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before
        me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and,
        behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

006:014 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
        ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

006:015 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The
        length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth
        of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

006:016 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
        finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the
        side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou
        make it.

006:017 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
        earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life,
        from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall
        die.

006:018 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt
        come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy
        sons' wives with thee.

006:019 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort
        shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee;
        they shall be male and female.

006:020 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
        every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every
        sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.

006:021 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou
        shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee,
        and for them.

006:022 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
        he.

007:001 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into
        the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this
        generation.

007:002 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the
        male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two,
        the male and his female.

007:003 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female;
        to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

007:004 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
        forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I
        have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.

007:005 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.

007:006 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters
        was upon the earth.

007:007 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
        wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the
        flood.

007:008 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of
        fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

007:009 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and
        the female, as God had commanded Noah.

007:010 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
        flood were upon the earth.

007:011 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
        the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the
        fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of
        heaven were opened.

007:012 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

007:013 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and
        Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three
        wives of his sons with them, into the ark;

007:014 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after
        their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
        earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every
        bird of every sort.

007:015 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
        flesh, wherein is the breath of life.

007:016 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,
        as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.

007:017 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
        increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the
        earth.

007:018 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
        earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

007:019 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all
        the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were
        covered.

007:020 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the
        mountains were covered.

007:021 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,
        and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that
        creepeth upon the earth, and every man:

007:022 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was
        in the dry land, died.

007:023 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the
        face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping
        things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed
        from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that
        were with him in the ark.

007:024 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
        days.

008:001 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
        cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to
        pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;

008:002 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were
        stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

008:003 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and
        after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were
        abated.

008:004 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth
        day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

008:005 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in
        the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops
        of the mountains seen.

008:006 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened
        the window of the ark which he had made:

008:007 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until
        the waters were dried up from off the earth.

008:008 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
        abated from off the face of the ground;

008:009 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she
        returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the
        face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took
        her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

008:010 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth
        the dove out of the ark;

008:011 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her
        mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the
        waters were abated from off the earth.

008:012 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
        which returned not again unto him any more.

008:013 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in
        the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were
        dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of
        the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was
        dry.

008:014 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
        month, was the earth dried.

008:015 And God spake unto Noah, saying,

008:016 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy
        sons' wives with thee.

008:017 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of
        all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping
        thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed
        abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon
        the earth.

008:018 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
        wives with him:

008:019 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and
        whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went
        forth out of the ark.

008:020 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every
        clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
        offerings on the altar.

008:021 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
        heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's
        sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his
        youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living,
        as I have done.

008:022 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
        heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not
        cease.

009:001 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
        fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

009:002 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every
        beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all
        that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the
        sea; into your hand are they delivered.

009:003 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as
        the green herb have I given you all things.

009:004 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof,
        shall ye not eat.

009:005 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the
        hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man;
        at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of
        man.

009:006 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed:
        for in the image of God made he man.

009:007 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly
        in the earth, and multiply therein.

009:008 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

009:009 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your
        seed after you;

009:010 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl,
        of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from
        all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

009:011 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all
        flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither
        shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

009:012 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
        between me and you and every living creature that is with you,
        for perpetual generations:

009:013 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
        covenant between me and the earth.

009:014 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the
        earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

009:015 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you
        and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall
        no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

009:016 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,
        that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and
        every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

009:017 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant,
        which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon
        the earth.

009:018 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,
        and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

009:019 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole
        earth overspread.

009:020 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

009:021 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was
        uncovered within his tent.

009:022 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his
        father, and told his two brethren without.

009:023 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both
        their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness
        of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw
        not their father's nakedness.

009:024 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son
        had done unto him.

009:025 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he
        be unto his brethren.

009:026 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall
        be his servant.

009:027 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
        Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

009:028 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

009:029 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years:
        and he died.

010:001 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,
        and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

010:002 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan,
        and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

010:003 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

010:004 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and
        Dodanim.

010:005 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their
        lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in
        their nations.

010:006 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

010:007 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and
        Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and
        Dedan.

010:008 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the
        earth.

010:009 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,
        Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

010:010 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
        Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

010:011 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and
        the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

010:012 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

010:013 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and
        Naphtuhim,

010:014 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
        Caphtorim.

010:015 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,

010:016 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

010:017 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

010:018 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and
        afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

010:019 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou
        comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and
        Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

010:020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
        tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

010:021 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the
        brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

010:022 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,
        and Aram.

010:023 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

010:024 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

010:025 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg;
        for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name
        was Joktan.

010:026 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
        Jerah,

010:027 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

010:028 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

010:029 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of
        Joktan.

010:030 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a
        mount of the east.

010:031 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
        tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

010:032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
        generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations
        divided in the earth after the flood.

011:001 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

011:002 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that
        they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt
        there.

011:003 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and
        burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime
        had they for morter.

011:004 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,
        whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name,
        lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

011:005 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which
        the children of men builded.

011:006 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have
        all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing
        will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

011:007 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
        they may not understand one another's speech.

011:008 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
        all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

011:009 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
        there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence
        did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
        earth.

011:010 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
        old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

011:011 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and
        begat sons and daughters.

011:012 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

011:013 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:014 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

011:015 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:016 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

011:017 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:018 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

011:019 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years,
        and begat sons and daughters.

011:020 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

011:021 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:022 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

011:023 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and
        begat sons and daughters.

011:024 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

011:025 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:026 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
        Haran.

011:027 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
        Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

011:028 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
        nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

011:029 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
        was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter
        of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

011:031 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his
        son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's
        wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,
        to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and
        dwelt there.

011:032 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and
        Terah died in Haran.

012:001 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
        and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land
        that I will shew thee:

012:002 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,
        and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

012:003 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that
        curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be
        blessed.

012:004 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot
        went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when
        he departed out of Haran.

012:005 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and
        all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that
        they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the
        land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.

012:006 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem,
        unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the
        land.

012:007 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will
        I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD,
        who appeared unto him.

012:008 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of
        Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and
        Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD,
        and called upon the name of the LORD.

012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

012:010 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
        Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the
        land.

012:011 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into
        Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know
        that thou art a fair woman to look upon:

012:012 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see
        thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will
        kill me, but they will save thee alive.

012:013 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
        me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
        Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

012:015 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
        Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

012:016 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,
        and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and
        she asses, and camels.

012:017 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
        because of Sarai Abram's wife.

012:018 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
        done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy
        wife?

012:019 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her
        to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go
        thy way.

012:020 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent
        him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

013:001 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that
        he had, and Lot with him, into the south.

013:002 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

013:003 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel,
        unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning,
        between Bethel and Hai;

013:004 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the
        first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.

013:005 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,
        and tents.

013:006 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
        together: for their substance was great, so that they could
        not dwell together.

013:007 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle
        and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the
        Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

013:008 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
        between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;
        for we be brethren.

013:009 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray
        thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go
        to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will
        go to the left.

013:010 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of
        Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD
        destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD,
        like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.

013:011 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
        east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

013:012 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
        cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

013:013 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
        exceedingly.

013:014 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated
        from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place
        where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and
        westward:

013:015 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and
        to thy seed for ever.

013:016 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if
        a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed
        also be numbered.

013:017 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
        breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

013:018 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain
        of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto
        the LORD.

014:001 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
        Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal
        king of nations;

014:002 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha
        king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of
        Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

014:003 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
        the salt sea.

014:004 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth
        year they rebelled.

014:005 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings
        that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth
        Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh
        Kiriathaim,

014:006 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by
        the wilderness.

014:007 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
        smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the
        Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.

014:008 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of
        Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and
        the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle
        with them in the vale of Siddim;

014:009 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of
        nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of
        Ellasar; four kings with five.

014:010 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
        Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that
        remained fled to the mountain.

014:011 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all
        their victuals, and went their way.

014:012 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,
        and his goods, and departed.

014:013 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the
        Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite,
        brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were
        confederate with Abram.

014:014 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
        armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three
        hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

014:015 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by
        night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is
        on the left hand of Damascus.

014:016 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
        brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the
        people.

014:017 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return
        from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were
        with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

014:018 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:
        and he was the priest of the most high God.

014:019 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most
        high God, possessor of heaven and earth:

014:020 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine
        enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

014:021 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons,
        and take the goods to thyself.

014:022 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
        unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and
        earth,

014:023 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
        that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou
        shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

014:024 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion
        of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let
        them take their portion.

015:001 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a
        vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy
        exceeding great reward.

015:002 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
        childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of
        Damascus?

015:003 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and,
        lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

015:004 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
        shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of
        thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

015:005 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
        heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them:
        and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

015:006 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
        righteousness.

015:007 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of
        Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

015:008 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall
        inherit it?

015:009 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,
        and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years
        old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

015:010 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
        and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided
        he not.

015:011 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove
        them away.

015:012 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
        and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

015:013 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall
        be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve
        them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;

015:014 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and
        afterward shall they come out with great substance.

015:015 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be
        buried in a good old age.

015:016 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for
        the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

015:017 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
        dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed
        between those pieces.

015:018 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
        Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt
        unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

015:019 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

015:020 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

015:021 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and
        the Jebusites.

016:001 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an
        handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

016:002 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath
        restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid;
        it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram
        hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

016:003 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after
        Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her
        to her husband Abram to be his wife.

016:004 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw
        that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

016:005 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given
        my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had
        conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between
        me and thee.

016:006 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand;
        do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly
        with her, she fled from her face.

016:007 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in
        the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and
        whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my
        mistress Sarai.

016:009 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy
        mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

016:010 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy
        seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

016:011 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with
        child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael;
        because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.

016:012 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,
        and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the
        presence of all his brethren.

016:013 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou
        God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him
        that seeth me?

016:014 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is
        between Kadesh and Bered.

016:015 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,
        which Hagar bare, Ishmael.

016:016 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare
        Ishmael to Abram.

017:001 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD
        appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God;
        walk before me, and be thou perfect.

017:002 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will
        multiply thee exceedingly.

017:003 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

017:004 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be
        a father of many nations.

017:005 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name
        shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made
        thee.

017:006 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make
        nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

017:007 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy
        seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting
        covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

017:008 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the
        land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for
        an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

017:009 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant
        therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

017:010 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you
        and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be
        circumcised.

017:011 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it
        shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

017:012 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,
        every man child in your generations, he that is born in the
        house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of
        thy seed.

017:013 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy
        money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in
        your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

017:014 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is
        not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people;
        he hath broken my covenant.

017:015 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt
        not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

017:016 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I
        will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of
        people shall be of her.

017:017 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
        heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years
        old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

017:018 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before
        thee!

017:019 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and
        thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my
        covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his
        seed after him.

017:020 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed
        him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him
        exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make
        him a great nation.

017:021 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall
        bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

017:022 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from
        Abraham.

017:023 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in
        his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male
        among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of
        their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

017:024 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was
        circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

017:025 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was
        circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

017:026 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
        son.

017:027 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought
        with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

018:001 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he
        sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

018:002 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood
        by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the
        tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,

018:003 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight,
        pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

018:004 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your
        feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

018:005 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your
        hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come
        to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

018:006 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
        ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make
        cakes upon the hearth.

018:007 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and
        good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had
        dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under
        the tree, and they did eat.

018:009 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
        Behold, in the tent.

018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to
        the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
        And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.

018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and
        it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

018:012 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am
        waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

018:013 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
        saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

018:014 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I
        will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and
        Sarah shall have a son.

018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
        And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

018:016 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
        Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

018:017 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which
        I do;

018:018 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
        nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in
        him?

018:019 For I know him, that he will command his children and his
        household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,
        to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon
        Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

018:020 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
        great, and because their sin is very grievous;

018:021 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
        according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,
        I will know.

018:022 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
        Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

018:023 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
        righteous with the wicked?

018:024 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt
        thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty
        righteous that are therein?

018:025 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the
        righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as
        the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all
        the earth do right?

018:026 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within
        the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

018:027 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon
        me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:

018:028 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
        wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,
        If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.

018:029 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there
        shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for
        forty's sake.

018:030 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
        speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he
        said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.

018:031 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto
        the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And
        he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

018:032 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak
        yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And
        he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.

018:033 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing
        with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

019:001 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
        gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and
        he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;

019:002 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into
        your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,
        and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they
        said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

019:003 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
        and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did
        bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of
        Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the
        people from every quarter:

019:005 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men
        which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that
        we may know them.

019:006 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door
        after him,

019:007 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

019:008 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let
        me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as
        is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for
        therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.

019:009 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one
        fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now
        will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed
        sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.

019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the
        house to them, and shut to the door.

019:011 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
        blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied
        themselves to find the door.

019:012 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
        law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast
        in the city, bring them out of this place:

019:013 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is
        waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath
        sent us to destroy it.

019:014 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which
        married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this
        place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as
        one that mocked unto his sons in law.

019:015 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
        saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are
        here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

019:016 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and
        upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two
        daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought
        him forth, and set him without the city.

019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
        that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,
        neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,
        lest thou be consumed.

019:018 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:

019:019 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and
        thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me
        in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest
        some evil take me, and I die:

019:020 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little
        one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and
        my soul shall live.

019:021 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning
        this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the
        which thou hast spoken.

019:022 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou
        be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called
        Zoar.

019:023 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

019:024 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone
        and fire from the LORD out of heaven;

019:025 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
        inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the
        ground.

019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
        pillar of salt.

019:027 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
        stood before the LORD:

019:028 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the
        land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the
        country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

019:029 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the
        plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the
        midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the
        which Lot dwelt.

019:030 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and
        his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar:
        and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

019:031 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,
        and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after
        the manner of all the earth:

019:032 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with
        him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

019:033 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the
        firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived
        not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said
        unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:
        let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,
        and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

019:035 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
        younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she
        lay down, nor when she arose.

019:036 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their
        father.

019:037 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the
        same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

019:038 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name
        Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto
        this day.

020:001 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,
        and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

020:002 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and
        Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to
        him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou
        hast taken; for she is a man's wife.

020:004 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt
        thou slay also a righteous nation?

020:005 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she
        herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart
        and innocency of my hands have I done this.

020:006 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
        this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee
        from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to
        touch her.

020:007 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,
        and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou
        restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,
        and all that are thine.

020:008 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all
        his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the
        men were sore afraid.

020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast
        thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou
        hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast
        done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.

020:010 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou
        hast done this thing?

020:011 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is
        not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

020:012 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my
        father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my
        wife.

020:013 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
        father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness
        which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall
        come, say of me, He is my brother.

020:014 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
        womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him
        Sarah his wife.

020:015 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell
        where it pleaseth thee.

020:016 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a
        thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of
        the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other:
        thus she was reproved.

020:017 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his
        wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.

020:018 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
        Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

021:001 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did
        unto Sarah as he had spoken.

021:002 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at
        the set time of which God had spoken to him.

021:003 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,
        whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

021:004 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as
        God had commanded him.

021:005 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was
        born unto him.

021:006 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that
        hear will laugh with me.

021:007 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah
        should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in
        his old age.

021:008 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great
        feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.

021:009 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had
        born unto Abraham, mocking.

021:010 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and
        her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with
        my son, even with Isaac.

021:011 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of
        his son.

021:012 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
        because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that
        Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in
        Isaac shall thy seed be called.

021:013 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
        because he is thy seed.

021:014 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and
        a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her
        shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed,
        and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

021:015 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
        under one of the shrubs.

021:016 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way
        off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the
        death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up
        her voice, and wept.

021:017 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God
        called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth
        thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad
        where he is.

021:018 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will
        make him a great nation.

021:019 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
        went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad
        drink.

021:020 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
        wilderness, and became an archer.

021:021 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took
        him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

021:022 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol
        the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God
        is with thee in all that thou doest:

021:023 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not
        deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son:
        but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou
        shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

021:024 And Abraham said, I will swear.

021:025 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,
        which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

021:026 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;
        neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to
        day.

021:027 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
        and both of them made a covenant.

021:028 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

021:029 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe
        lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

021:030 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my
        hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged
        this well.

021:031 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they
        sware both of them.

021:032 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose
        up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they
        returned into the land of the Philistines.

021:033 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on
        the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

021:034 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

022:001 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
        Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here
        I am.

022:002 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
        lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him
        there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I
        will tell thee of.

022:003 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
        and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and
        clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went
        unto the place of which God had told him.

022:004 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
        place afar off.

022:005 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the
        ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come
        again to you.

022:006 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it
        upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a
        knife; and they went both of them together.

022:007 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:
        and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire
        and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

022:008 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for
        a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.

022:009 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and
        Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and
        bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

022:010 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to
        slay his son.

022:011 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and
        said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.

022:012 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
        any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God,
        seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

022:013 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
        him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went
        and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in
        the stead of his son.

022:014 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it
        is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be
        seen.

022:015 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven
        the second time,

022:016 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because
        thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,
        thine only son:

022:017 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
        multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
        which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the
        gate of his enemies;

022:018 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
        because thou hast obeyed my voice.

022:019 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and
        went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

022:020 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told
        Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children
        unto thy brother Nahor;

022:021 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father
        of Aram,

022:022 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

022:023 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to
        Nahor, Abraham's brother.

022:024 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,
        and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

023:001 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these
        were the years of the life of Sarah.

023:002 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land
        of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep
        for her.

023:003 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
        sons of Heth, saying,

023:004 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession
        of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my
        sight.

023:005 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,

023:006 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the
        choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall
        withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury
        thy dead.

023:007 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the
        land, even to the children of Heth.

023:008 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I
        should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for
        me to Ephron the son of Zohar,

023:009 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath,
        which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is
        worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace
        amongst you.

023:010 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the
        Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of
        Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city,
        saying,

023:011 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave
        that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons
        of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.

023:012 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

023:013 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
        land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me:
        I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I
        will bury my dead there.

023:014 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

023:015 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred
        shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury
        therefore thy dead.

023:016 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to
        Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the
        sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money
        with the merchant.

023:017 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was
        before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and
        all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the
        borders round about, were made sure

023:018 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children
        of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

023:019 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of
        the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the
        land of Canaan.

023:020 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure
        unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of
        Heth.

024:001 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD
        had blessed Abraham in all things.

024:002 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that
        ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under
        my thigh:

024:003 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and
        the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my
        son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:

024:004 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take
        a wife unto my son Isaac.

024:005 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not
        be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy
        son again unto the land from whence thou camest?

024:006 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my
        son thither again.

024:007 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,
        and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and
        that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this
        land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take
        a wife unto my son from thence.

024:008 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
        shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son
        thither again.

024:009 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
        master, and sware to him concerning that matter.

024:010 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,
        and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his
        hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of
        Nahor.

024:011 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a
        well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that
        women go out to draw water.

024:012 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send
        me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master
        Abraham.

024:013 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters
        of the men of the city come out to draw water:

024:014 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,
        Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she
        shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let
        the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant
        Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness
        unto my master.

024:015 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that,
        behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of
        Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher
        upon her shoulder.

024:016 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither
        had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and
        filled her pitcher, and came up.

024:017 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray
        thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.

024:018 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
        pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

024:019 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
        water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

024:020 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and
        ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his
        camels.

024:021 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether
        the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.

024:022 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the
        man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two
        bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;

024:023 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is
        there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

024:024 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of
        Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

024:025 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
        enough, and room to lodge in.

024:026 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.

024:027 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who
        hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth:
        I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my
        master's brethren.

024:028 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these
        things.

024:029 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban
        ran out unto the man, unto the well.

024:030 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets
        upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of
        Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that
        he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at
        the well.

024:031 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore
        standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room
        for the camels.

024:032 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels,
        and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash
        his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.

024:033 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will
        not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

024:034 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

024:035 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become
        great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver,
        and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and
        asses.

024:036 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she
        was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

024:037 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a
        wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose
        land I dwell:

024:038 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred,
        and take a wife unto my son.

024:039 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not
        follow me.

024:040 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send
        his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take
        a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:

024:041 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest
        to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be
        clear from my oath.

024:042 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my
        master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:

024:043 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to
        pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I
        say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy
        pitcher to drink;

024:044 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for
        thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath
        appointed out for my master's son.

024:045 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah
        came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down
        unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me
        drink, I pray thee.

024:046 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her
        shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink
        also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

024:047 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
        said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare
        unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the
        bracelets upon her hands.

024:048 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed
        the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the
        right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

024:049 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell
        me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or
        to the left.

024:050 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth
        from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

024:051 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her
        be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.

024:052 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their
        words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.

024:053 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of
        gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to
        her brother and to her mother precious things.

024:054 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,
        and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he
        said, Send me away unto my master.

024:055 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with
        us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.

024:056 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath
        prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

024:057 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her
        mouth.

024:058 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with
        this man? And she said, I will go.

024:059 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
        Abraham's servant, and his men.

024:060 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our
        sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let
        thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.

024:061 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the
        camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah,
        and went his way.

024:062 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt
        in the south country.

024:063 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:
        and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels
        were coming.

024:064 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she
        lighted off the camel.

024:065 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that
        walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It
        is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

024:066 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

024:067 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
        Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac
        was comforted after his mother's death.

025:001 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

025:002 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian,
        and Ishbak, and Shuah.

025:003 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
        Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

025:004 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and
        Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

025:005 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

025:006 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had,
        Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son,
        while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.

025:007 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he
        lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

025:008 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an
        old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

025:009 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
        Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the
        Hittite, which is before Mamre;

025:010 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there
        was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

025:011 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God
        blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

025:012 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom
        Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

025:013 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their
        names, according to their generations: the firstborn of
        Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

025:014 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

025:015 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

025:016 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by
        their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to
        their nations.

025:017 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
        thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and
        was gathered unto his people.

025:018 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt,
        as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of
        all his brethren.

025:019 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham
        begat Isaac:

025:020 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife,
        the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to
        Laban the Syrian.

025:021 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was
        barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his
        wife conceived.

025:022 And the children struggled together within her; and she said,
        If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the
        LORD.

025:023 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and
        two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and
        the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and
        the elder shall serve the younger.

025:024 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,
        there were twins in her womb.

025:025 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment;
        and they called his name Esau.

025:026 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
        Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was
        threescore years old when she bare them.

025:027 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
        field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

025:028 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but
        Rebekah loved Jacob.

025:029 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he
        was faint:

025:030 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same
        red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called
        Edom.

025:031 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

025:032 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what
        profit shall this birthright do to me?

025:033 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him:
        and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

025:034 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did
        eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau
        despised his birthright.

026:001 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine
        that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech
        king of the Philistines unto Gerar.

026:002 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into
        Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:

026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless
        thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these
        countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto
        Abraham thy father;

026:004 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,
        and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy
        seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;

026:005 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
        commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

026:006 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:

026:007 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said,
        She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest,
        said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah;
        because she was fair to look upon.

026:008 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
        Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and
        saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

026:009 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she
        is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac
        said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.

026:010 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one
        of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou
        shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.

026:011 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth
        this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

026:012 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year
        an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.

026:013 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he
        became very great:

026:014 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and
        great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.

026:015 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in
        the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped
        them, and filled them with earth.

026:016 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
        mightier than we.

026:017 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley
        of Gerar, and dwelt there.

026:018 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had
        digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines
        had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called
        their names after the names by which his father had called
        them.

026:019 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a
        well of springing water.

026:020 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,
        saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well
        Esek; because they strove with him.

026:021 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
        called the name of it Sitnah.

026:022 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for
        that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth;
        and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we
        shall be fruitful in the land.

026:023 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

026:024 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am
        the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,
        and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant
        Abraham's sake.

026:025 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
        LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants
        digged a well.

026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
        friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

026:027 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye
        hate me, and have sent me away from you?

026:028 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee:
        and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt
        us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;

026:029 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and
        as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee
        away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.

026:030 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

026:031 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to
        another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him
        in peace.

026:032 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,
        and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and
        said unto him, We have found water.

026:033 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is
        Beersheba unto this day.

026:034 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
        daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of
        Elon the Hittite:

026:035 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

027:001 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes
        were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest
        son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,
        here am I.

027:002 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my
        death:

027:003 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and
        thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;

027:004 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me,
        that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

027:005 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau
        went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

027:006 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard
        thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

027:007 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat,
        and bless thee before the LORD before my death.

027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
        command thee.

027:009 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of
        the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,
        such as he loveth:

027:010 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and
        that he may bless thee before his death.

027:011 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother
        is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:

027:012 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him
        as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a
        blessing.

027:013 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:
        only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

027:014 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and
        his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.

027:015 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
        were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her
        younger son:

027:016 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,
        and upon the smooth of his neck:

027:017 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had
        prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

027:018 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,
        Here am I; who art thou, my son?

027:019 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I
        have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit
        and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

027:020 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it
        so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God
        brought it to me.

027:021 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may
        feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

027:022 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him,
        and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the
        hands of Esau.

027:023 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
        brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.

027:024 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

027:025 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's
        venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near
        to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.

027:026 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss
        me, my son.

027:027 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of
        his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my
        son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:

027:028 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness
        of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

027:029 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord
        over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:
        cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that
        blesseth thee.

027:030 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of
        blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the
        presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in
        from his hunting.

027:031 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his
        father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat
        of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

027:032 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said,
        I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

027:033 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is
        he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have
        eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,
        and he shall be blessed.

027:034 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a
        great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father,
        Bless me, even me also, O my father.

027:035 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken
        away thy blessing.

027:036 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath
        supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright;
        and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said,
        Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

027:037 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him
        thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for
        servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and
        what shall I do now unto thee, my son?

027:038 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my
        father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted
        up his voice, and wept.

027:039 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
        dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of
        heaven from above;

027:040 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;
        and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion,
        that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

027:041 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his
        father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of
        mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my
        brother Jacob.

027:042 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:
        and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto
        him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort
        himself, purposing to kill thee.

027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to
        Laban my brother to Haran;

027:044 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn
        away;

027:045 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget
        that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch
        thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in
        one day?

027:046 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of
        the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters
        of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land,
        what good shall my life do me?

028:001 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and
        said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of
        Canaan.

028:002 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's
        father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of
        Laban thy mother's brother.

028:003 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and
        multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;

028:004 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy
        seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou
        art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.

028:005 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto
        Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,
        Jacob's and Esau's mother.

028:006 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away
        to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he
        blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take
        a wife of the daughers of Canaan;

028:007 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone
        to Padanaram;

028:008 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac
        his father;

028:009 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he
        had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister
        of Nebajoth, to be his wife.

028:010 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

028:011 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all
        night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of
        that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that
        place to sleep.

028:012 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and
        the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God
        ascending and descending on it.

028:013 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD
        God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land
        whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;

028:014 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt
        spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,
        and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the
        families of the earth be blessed.

028:015 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
        whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land;
        for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have
        spoken to thee of.

028:016 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the
        LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.

028:017 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this
        is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of
        heaven.

028:018 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone
        that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar,
        and poured oil upon the top of it.

028:019 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of
        that city was called Luz at the first.

028:020 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and
        will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to
        eat, and raiment to put on,

028:021 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall
        the LORD be my God:

028:022 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's
        house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give
        the tenth unto thee.

029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
        people of the east.

029:002 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
        were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well
        they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's
        mouth.

029:003 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the
        stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put
        the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.

029:004 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they
        said, Of Haran are we.

029:005 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And
        they said, We know him.

029:006 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:
        and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

029:007 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that
        the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep,
        and go and feed them.

029:008 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
        together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth;
        then we water the sheep.

029:009 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her
        father's sheep; for she kept them.

029:010 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of
        Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his
        mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone
        from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his
        mother's brother.

029:011 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

029:012 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and
        that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.

029:013 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
        sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and
        kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban
        all these things.

029:014 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.
        And he abode with him the space of a month.

029:015 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,
        shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what
        shall thy wages be?

029:016 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah,
        and the name of the younger was Rachel.

029:017 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well
        favoured.

029:018 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven
        years for Rachel thy younger daughter.

029:019 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than
        that I should give her to another man: abide with me.

029:020 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto
        him but a few days, for the love he had to her.

029:021 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
        fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

029:022 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made
        a feast.

029:023 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
        daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

029:024 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
        handmaid.

029:025 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:
        and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did
        not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou
        beguiled me?

029:026 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give
        the younger before the firstborn.

029:027 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the
        service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

029:028 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him
        Rachel his daughter to wife also.

029:029 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to
        be her maid.

029:030 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more
        than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

029:031 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:
        but Rachel was barren.

029:032 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name
        Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my
        affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.

029:033 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the
        LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this
        son also: and she called his name Simeon.

029:034 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this
        time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born
        him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.

029:035 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now
        will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah;
        and left bearing.

030:001 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel
        envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or
        else I die.

030:002 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am
        I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the
        womb?

030:003 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she
        shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by
        her.

030:004 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went
        in unto her.

030:005 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.

030:006 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my
        voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name
        Dan.

030:007 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a
        second son.

030:008 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
        sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name
        Naphtali.

030:009 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her
        maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.

030:010 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.

030:011 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.

030:012 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.

030:013 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me
        blessed: and she called his name Asher.

030:014 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found
        mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.
        Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's
        mandrakes.

030:015 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast
        taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's
        mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with
        thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.

030:016 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went
        out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for
        surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay
        with her that night.

030:017 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob
        the fifth son.

030:018 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given
        my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.

030:019 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.

030:020 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will
        my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons:
        and she called his name Zebulun.

030:021 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

030:022 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and
        opened her womb.

030:023 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken
        away my reproach:

030:024 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add
        to me another son.

030:025 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob
        said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own
        place, and to my country.

030:026 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,
        and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done
        thee.

030:027 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour
        in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that
        the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.

030:028 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

030:029 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and
        how thy cattle was with me.

030:030 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is
        now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee
        since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own
        house also?

030:031 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou
        shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for
        me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.

030:032 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence
        all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle
        among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats:
        and of such shall be my hire.

030:033 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when
        it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is
        not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the
        sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

030:034 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy
        word.

030:035 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
        spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,
        and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown
        among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

030:036 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and
        Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

030:037 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
        chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the
        white appear which was in the rods.

030:038 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in
        the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to
        drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.

030:039 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth
        cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

030:040 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the
        flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock
        of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put
        them not unto Laban's cattle.

030:041 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did
        conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the
        cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the
        rods.

030:042 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the
        feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

030:043 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
        maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

031:001 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath
        taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was
        our father's hath he gotten all this glory.

031:002 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was
        not toward him as before.

031:003 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy
        fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

031:004 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto
        his flock,

031:005 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it
        is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been
        with me.

031:006 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

031:007 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten
        times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.

031:008 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the
        cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked
        shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

031:009 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
        them to me.

031:010 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived,
        that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold,
        the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked,
        speckled, and grisled.

031:011 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:
        And I said, Here am I.

031:012 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams
        which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and
        grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

031:013 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and
        where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from
        this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.

031:014 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet
        any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

031:015 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and
        hath quite devoured also our money.

031:016 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that
        is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath
        said unto thee, do.

031:017 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon
        camels;

031:018 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he
        had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in
        Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of
        Canaan.

031:019 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the
        images that were her father's.

031:020 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he
        told him not that he fled.

031:021 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed
        over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

031:022 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

031:023 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven
        days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

031:024 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said
        unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good
        or bad.

031:025 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in
        the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of
        Gilead.

031:026 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast
        stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as
        captives taken with the sword?

031:027 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from
        me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away
        with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?

031:028 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?
        thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.

031:029 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of
        your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed
        that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

031:030 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
        longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou
        stolen my gods?

031:031 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:
        for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy
        daughters from me.

031:032 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:
        before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and
        take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen
        them.

031:033 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and
        into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then
        went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

031:034 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's
        furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,
        but found them not.

031:035 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that
        I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon
        me. And he searched but found not the images.

031:036 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
        and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that
        thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

031:037 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found
        of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and
        thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

031:038 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she
        goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock
        have I not eaten.

031:039 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare
        the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether
        stolen by day, or stolen by night.

031:040 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost
        by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

031:041 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee
        fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy
        cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

031:042 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear
        of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now
        empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my
        hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.

031:043 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
        daughters, and these children are my children, and these
        cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and
        what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their
        children which they have born?

031:044 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;
        and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

031:045 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

031:046 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
        stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the
        heap.

031:047 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it
        Galeed.

031:048 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee
        this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;

031:049 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,
        when we are absent one from another.

031:050 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take
        other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God
        is witness betwixt me and thee.

031:051 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
        pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:

031:052 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will
        not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass
        over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their
        father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his
        father Isaac.

031:054 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his
        brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all
        night in the mount.

031:055 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons
        and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and
        returned unto his place.

032:001 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

032:002 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he
        called the name of that place Mahanaim.

032:003 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto
        the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

032:004 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my
        lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with
        Laban, and stayed there until now:

032:005 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and
        womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may
        find grace in thy sight.

032:006 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
        brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four
        hundred men with him.

032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided
        the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and
        the camels, into two bands;

032:008 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then
        the other company which is left shall escape.

032:009 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my
        father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy
        country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all
        the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with
        my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two
        bands.

032:011 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the
        hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,
        and the mother with the children.

032:012 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
        as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for
        multitude.

032:013 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which
        came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;

032:014 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,
        and twenty rams,

032:015 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten
        bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.

032:016 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every
        drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over
        before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.

032:017 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
        meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and
        whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?

032:018 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a
        present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind
        us.

032:019 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
        followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak
        unto Esau, when ye find him.

032:020 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.
        For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth
        before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he
        will accept of me.

032:021 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that
        night in the company.

032:022 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
        womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford
        Jabbok.

032:023 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
        that he had.

032:024 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him
        until the breaking of the day.

032:025 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
        the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
        out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

032:026 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
        will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

032:027 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

032:028 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but
        Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,
        and hast prevailed.

032:029 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
        And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?
        And he blessed him there.

032:030 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen
        God face to face, and my life is preserved.

032:031 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
        halted upon his thigh.

032:032 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which
        shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:
        because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew
        that shrank.

033:001 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau
        came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the
        children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two
        handmaids.

033:002 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah
        and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

033:003 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the
        ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

033:004 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his
        neck, and kissed him: and they wept.

033:005 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;
        and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children
        which God hath graciously given thy servant.

033:006 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and
        they bowed themselves.

033:007 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed
        themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they
        bowed themselves.

033:008 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?
        And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

033:009 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast
        unto thyself.

033:010 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in
        thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I
        have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and
        thou wast pleased with me.

033:011 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;
        because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have
        enough. And he urged him, and he took it.

033:012 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I
        will go before thee.

033:013 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are
        tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and
        if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

033:014 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I
        will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before
        me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my
        lord unto Seir.

033:015 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk
        that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find
        grace in the sight of my lord.

033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

033:017 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and
        made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is
        called Succoth.

033:018 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the
        land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his
        tent before the city.

033:019 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his
        tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father,
        for an hundred pieces of money.

033:020 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.

034:001 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,
        went out to see the daughters of the land.

034:002 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
        country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled
        her.

034:003 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he
        loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

034:004 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this
        damsel to wife.

034:005 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now
        his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his
        peace until they were come.

034:006 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
        with him.

034:007 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard
        it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,
        because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's
        daughter: which thing ought not to be done.

034:008 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son
        Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to
        wife.

034:009 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto
        us, and take our daughters unto you.

034:010 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;
        dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

034:011 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me
        find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will
        give.

034:012 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
        as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.

034:013 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
        deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their
        sister:

034:014 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our
        sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach
        unto us:

034:015 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,
        that every male of you be circumcised;

034:016 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take
        your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will
        become one people.

034:017 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then
        will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.

034:018 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

034:019 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
        delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than
        all the house of his father.

034:020 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their
        city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,

034:021 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in
        the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large
        enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives,
        and let us give them our daughters.

034:022 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,
        to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as
        they are circumcised.

034:023 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of
        their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will
        dwell with us.

034:024 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that
        went out of the gate of his city; and every male was
        circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.

034:025 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,
        that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's
        brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city
        boldly, and slew all the males.

034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
        sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
        because they had defiled their sister.

034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and
        that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,

034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their
        wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the
        house.

034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
        me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the
        Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they
        shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and
        I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

034:031 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an
        harlot?

035:001 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell
        there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto
        thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

035:002 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with
        him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be
        clean, and change your garments:

035:003 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there
        an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress,
        and was with me in the way which I went.

035:004 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in
        their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears;
        and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

035:005 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities
        that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the
        sons of Jacob.

035:006 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
        Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

035:007 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:
        because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the
        face of his brother.

035:008 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath
        Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called
        Allonbachuth.

035:009 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of
        Padanaram, and blessed him.

035:010 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not
        be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he
        called his name Israel.

035:011 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and
        multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee,
        and kings shall come out of thy loins;

035:012 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will
        give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

035:013 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with
        him.

035:014 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with
        him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering
        thereon, and he poured oil thereon.

035:015 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with
        him, Bethel.

035:016 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way
        to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard
        labour.

035:017 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the
        midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son
        also.

035:018 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she
        died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called
        him Benjamin.

035:019 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which
        is Bethlehem.

035:020 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of
        Rachel's grave unto this day.

035:021 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of
        Edar.

035:022 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that
        Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and
        Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

035:023 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and
        Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:

035:024 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:

035:025 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

035:026 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these
        are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

035:027 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city
        of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

035:028 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

035:029 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto
        his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and
        Jacob buried him.

036:001 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

036:002 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the
        daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of
        Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

036:003 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

036:004 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

036:005 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are
        the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of
        Canaan.

036:006 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and
        all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his
        beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of
        Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother
        Jacob.

036:007 For their riches were more than that they might dwell
        together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not
        bear them because of their cattle.

036:008 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

036:009 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the
        Edomites in mount Seir:

036:010 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah
        the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.

036:011 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam,
        and Kenaz.

036:012 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to
        Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.

036:013 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah,
        and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

036:014 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah
        the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau
        Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.

036:015 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the
        firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke
        Kenaz,

036:016 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes
        that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons
        of Adah.

036:017 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke
        Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that
        came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of
        Bashemath Esau's wife.

036:018 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush,
        duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of
        Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

036:019 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their
        dukes.

036:020 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;
        Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

036:021 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the
        Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

036:022 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's
        sister was Timna.

036:023 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath,
        and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

036:024 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah:
        this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as
        he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.

036:025 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah
        the daughter of Anah.

036:026 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and
        Ithran, and Cheran.

036:027 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.

036:028 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.

036:029 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke
        Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,

036:030 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that
        came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.

036:031 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,
        before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

036:032 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his
        city was Dinhabah.

036:033 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in
        his stead.

036:034 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in
        his stead.

036:035 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian
        in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of
        his city was Avith.

036:036 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

036:037 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in
        his stead.

036:038 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his
        stead.

036:039 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his
        stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name
        was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of
        Mezahab.

036:040 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau,
        according to their families, after their places, by their
        names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,

036:041 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,

036:042 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,

036:043 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according
        to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is
        Esau the father of the Edomites.

037:001 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger,
        in the land of Canaan.

037:002 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen
        years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the
        lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah,
        his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their
        evil report.

037:003 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he
        was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many
        colours.

037:004 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more
        than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak
        peaceably unto him.

037:005 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and
        they hated him yet the more.

037:006 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I
        have dreamed:

037:007 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my
        sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves
        stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

037:008 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us?
        or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him
        yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.

037:009 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,
        and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold,
        the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to
        me.

037:010 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his
        father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that
        thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren
        indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?

037:011 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the
        saying.

037:012 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

037:013 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the
        flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he
        said to him, Here am I.

037:014 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well
        with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word
        again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came
        to Shechem.

037:015 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in
        the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

037:016 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where
        they feed their flocks.

037:017 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them
        say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,
        and found them in Dothan.

037:018 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
        them, they conspired against him to slay him.

037:019 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.

037:020 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into
        some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him:
        and we shall see what will become of his dreams.

037:021 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
        and said, Let us not kill him.

037:022 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into
        this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;
        that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to
        his father again.

037:023 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
        that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many
        colours that was on him;

037:024 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was
        empty, there was no water in it.

037:025 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes
        and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from
        Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,
        going to carry it down to Egypt.

037:026 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay
        our brother, and conceal his blood?

037:027 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our
        hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his
        brethren were content.

037:028 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
        lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the
        Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought
        Joseph into Egypt.

037:029 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not
        in the pit; and he rent his clothes.

037:030 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;
        and I, whither shall I go?

037:031 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats,
        and dipped the coat in the blood;

037:032 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to
        their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether
        it be thy son's coat or no.

037:033 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast
        hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

037:034 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
        and mourned for his son many days.

037:035 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
        but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go
        down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept
        for him.

037:036 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an
        officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

038:001 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from
        his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose
        name was Hirah.

038:002 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose
        name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

038:003 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

038:004 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his
        name Onan.

038:005 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his
        name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

038:006 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was
        Tamar.

038:007 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the
        LORD; and the LORD slew him.

038:008 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and
        marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

038:009 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to
        pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled
        it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his
        brother.

038:010 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he
        slew him also.

038:011 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow
        at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he
        said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And
        Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.

038:012 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife
        died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his
        sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the
        Adullamite.

038:013 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth
        up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

038:014 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her
        with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,
        which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was
        grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because
        she had covered her face.

038:016 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray
        thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was
        his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me,
        that thou mayest come in unto me?

038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she
        said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy
        signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine
        hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she
        conceived by him.

038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,
        and put on the garments of her widowhood.

038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the
        Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but
        he found her not.

038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the
        harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There
        was no harlot in this place.

038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and
        also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in
        this place.

038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:
        behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
        Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the
        harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And
        Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,
        saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she
        said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and
        bracelets, and staff.

038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more
        righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my
        son. And he knew her again no more.

038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,
        twins were in her womb.

038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
        his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a
        scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,
        his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken
        forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called
        Pharez.

038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet
        thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer
        of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of
        the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down
        thither.

039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and
        he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the
        LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he
        made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put
        into his hand.

039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him
        overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD
        blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the
        blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,
        and in the field.

039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not
        ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was
        a goodly person, and well favoured.

039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife
        cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my
        master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath
        committed all that he hath to my hand;

039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he
        kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his
        wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
        God?

039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that
        he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.

039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the
        house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the
        house there within.

039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he
        left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment
        in her hand, and was fled forth,

039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto
        them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to
        mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a
        loud voice:

039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice
        and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got
        him out.

039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
        Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto
        me to mock me:

039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that
        he left his garment with me, and fled out.

039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his
        wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did
        thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.

039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a
        place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there
        in the prison.

039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave
        him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

039:022 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all
        the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did
        there, he was the doer of it.

039:023 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was
        under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which
        he did, the LORD made it to prosper.

040:001 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the
        king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king
        of Egypt.

040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the
        chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the
        guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
        served them: and they continued a season in ward.

040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in
        one night, each man according to the interpretation of his
        dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which
        were bound in the prison.

040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
        them, and, behold, they were sad.

040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward
        of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to
        day?

040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is
        no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not
        interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.

040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to
        him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;

040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it
        budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof
        brought forth ripe grapes:

040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and
        pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into
        Pharaoh's hand.

040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:
        The three branches are three days:

040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and
        restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's
        cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his
        butler.

040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
        kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto
        Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:

040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:
        and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into
        the dungeon.

040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he
        said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had
        three white baskets on my head:

040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of
        bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the
        basket upon my head.

040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
        thereof: The three baskets are three days:

040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off
        thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat
        thy flesh from off thee.

040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's
        birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he
        lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker
        among his servants.

040:021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;
        and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:

040:022 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to
        them.

040:023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

041:001 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
        dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

041:002 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well
        favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

041:003 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
        river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other
        kine upon the brink of the river.

041:004 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
        well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

041:005 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven
        ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

041:006 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
        sprung up after them.

041:007 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
        And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

041:008 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was
        troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of
        Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his
        dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto
        Pharaoh.

041:009 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do
        remember my faults this day:

041:010 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
        captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:

041:011 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each
        man according to the interpretation of his dream.

041:012 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to
        the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted
        to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did
        interpret.

041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
        restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him
        hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed
        his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.

041:015 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and
        there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of
        thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

041:016 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God
        shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

041:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood
        upon the bank of the river:

041:018 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,
        fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

041:019 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and
        very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all
        the land of Egypt for badness:

041:020 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first
        seven fat kine:

041:021 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that
        they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at
        the beginning. So I awoke.

041:022 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one
        stalk, full and good:

041:023 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the
        east wind, sprung up after them:

041:024 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told
        this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare
        it to me.

041:025 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
        hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.

041:026 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears
        are seven years: the dream is one.

041:027 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after
        them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with
        the east wind shall be seven years of famine.

041:028 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God
        is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
        the land of Egypt:

041:030 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and
        all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and
        the famine shall consume the land;

041:031 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of
        that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.

041:032 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
        because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly
        bring it to pass.

041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,
        and set him over the land of Egypt.

041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the
        land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the
        seven plenteous years.

041:035 And let them gather all the food of those good years that
        come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them
        keep food in the cities.

041:036 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
        years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the
        land perish not through the famine.

041:037 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
        of all his servants.

041:038 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as
        this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

041:039 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed
        thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:

041:040 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall
        all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater
        than thou.

041:041 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all
        the land of Egypt.

041:042 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
        Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and
        put a gold chain about his neck;

041:043 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had;
        and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler
        over all the land of Egypt.

041:044 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee
        shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of
        Egypt.

041:045 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave
        him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.
        And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.

041:046 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh
        king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of
        Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

041:047 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
        handfuls.

041:048 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were
        in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the
        food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he
        up in the same.

041:049 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
        until he left numbering; for it was without number.

041:050 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine
        came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On
        bare unto him.

041:051 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,
        said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's
        house.

041:052 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath
        caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

041:053 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of
        Egypt, were ended.

041:054 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as
        Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all
        the land of Egypt there was bread.

041:055 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried
        to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians,
        Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

041:056 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph
        opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and
        the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

041:057 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;
        because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

042:001 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said
        unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

042:002 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:
        get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may
        live, and not die.

042:003 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

042:004 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his
        brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

042:005 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:
        for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

042:006 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that
        sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren
        came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to
        the earth.

042:007 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made
        himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he
        said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land
        of Canaan to buy food.

042:008 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

042:009 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and
        said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land
        ye are come.

042:010 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
        servants come.

042:011 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are
        no spies.

042:012 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the
        land ye are come.

042:013 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of
        one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is
        this day with our father, and one is not.

042:014 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,
        saying, Ye are spies:

042:015 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not
        go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

042:016 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall
        be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether
        there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh
        surely ye are spies.

042:017 And he put them all together into ward three days.

042:018 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;
        for I fear God:

042:019 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the
        house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your
        houses:

042:020 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words
        be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

042:021 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
        our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he
        besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress
        come upon us.

042:022 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you,
        saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?
        therefore, behold, also his blood is required.

042:023 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake
        unto them by an interpreter.

042:024 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned
        to them again, and communed with them, and took from them
        Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

042:025 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to
        restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them
        provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.

042:026 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

042:027 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender
        in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his
        sack's mouth.

042:028 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,
        it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they
        were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath
        done unto us?

042:029 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,
        and told him all that befell unto them; saying,

042:030 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and
        took us for spies of the country.

042:031 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:

042:032 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the
        youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

042:033 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby
        shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren
        here with me, and take food for the famine of your households,
        and be gone:

042:034 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know
        that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I
        deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,
        every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both
        they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were
        afraid.

042:036 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of
        my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will
        take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.

042:037 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if
        I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will
        bring him to thee again.

042:038 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his
        brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him
        by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my
        gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

043:001 And the famine was sore in the land.

043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which
        they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go
        again, buy us a little food.

043:003 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
        unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
        be with you.

043:004 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
        thee food:

043:005 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the
        man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your
        brother be with you.

043:006 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell
        the man whether ye had yet a brother?

043:007 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of
        our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another
        brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these
        words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your
        brother down?

043:008 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me,
        and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both
        we, and thou, and also our little ones.

043:009 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:
        if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then
        let me bear the blame for ever:

043:010 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this
        second time.

043:011 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now,
        do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,
        and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little
        honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:

043:012 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was
        brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in
        your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:

043:013 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:

043:014 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may
        send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved
        of my children, I am bereaved.

043:015 And the men took that present, and they took double money in
        their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt,
        and stood before Joseph.

043:016 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler
        of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready;
        for these men shall dine with me at noon.

043:017 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men
        into Joseph's house.

043:018 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into
        Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was
        returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in;
        that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and
        take us for bondmen, and our asses.

043:019 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they
        communed with him at the door of the house,

043:020 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy
        food:

043:021 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened
        our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of
        his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it
        again in our hand.

043:022 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:
        we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

043:023 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God
        of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had
        your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.

043:024 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them
        water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses
        provender.

043:025 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:
        for they heard that they should eat bread there.

043:026 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
        was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him
        to the earth.

043:027 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
        well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?

043:028 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,
        he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made
        obeisance.

043:029 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
        mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom
        ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my
        son.

043:030 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
        brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his
        chamber, and wept there.

043:031 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,
        and said, Set on bread.

043:032 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by
        themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by
        themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the
        Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

043:033 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his
        birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the
        men marvelled one at another.

043:034 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
        Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And
        they drank, and were merry with him.

044:001 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the
        men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put
        every man's money in his sack's mouth.

044:002 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the
        youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word
        that Joseph had spoken.

044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
        and their asses.

044:004 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
        Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and
        when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye
        rewarded evil for good?

044:005 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed
        he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

044:006 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

044:007 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?
        God forbid that thy servants should do according to this
        thing:

044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we
        brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then
        should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?

044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,
        and we also will be my lord's bondmen.

044:010 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he
        with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be
        blameless.

044:011 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,
        and opened every man his sack.

044:012 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the
        youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

044:013 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
        returned to the city.

044:014 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was
        yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.

044:015 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have
        done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

044:016 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we
        speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the
        iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants,
        both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.

044:017 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in
        whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as
        for you, get you up in peace unto your father.

044:018 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
        servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let
        not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as
        Pharaoh.

044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a
        brother?

044:020 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a
        child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead,
        and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

044:021 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,
        that I may set mine eyes upon him.

044:022 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for
        if he should leave his father, his father would die.

044:023 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest
        brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

044:024 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my
        father, we told him the words of my lord.

044:025 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

044:026 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be
        with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's
        face, except our youngest brother be with us.

044:027 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife
        bare me two sons:

044:028 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in
        pieces; and I saw him not since:

044:029 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye
        shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

044:030 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the
        lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the
        lad's life;

044:031 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with
        us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the
        gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

044:032 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,
        saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the
        blame to my father for ever.

044:033 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of
        the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his
        brethren.

044:034 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with
        me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my
        father.

045:001 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that
        stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.
        And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself
        known unto his brethren.

045:002 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
        heard.

045:003 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father
        yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were
        troubled at his presence.

045:004 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray
        you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your
        brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.

045:005 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that
        ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve
        life.

045:006 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet
        there are five years, in the which there shall neither be
        earing nor harvest.

045:007 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
        earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

045:008 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he
        hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house,
        and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.

045:009 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith
        thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down
        unto me, tarry not:

045:010 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be
        near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's
        children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou
        hast:

045:011 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of
        famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast,
        come to poverty.

045:012 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother
        Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

045:013 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of
        all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my
        father hither.

045:014 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and
        Benjamin wept upon his neck.

045:015 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and
        after that his brethren talked with him.

045:016 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,
        Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and
        his servants.

045:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do
        ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

045:018 And take your father and your households, and come unto me:
        and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye
        shall eat the fat of the land.

045:019 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the
        land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and
        bring your father, and come.

045:020 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of
        Egypt is your's.

045:021 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them
        wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them
        provision for the way.

045:022 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
        Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five
        changes of raiment.

045:023 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden
        with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with
        corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.

045:024 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said
        unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

045:025 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of
        Canaan unto Jacob their father,

045:026 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor
        over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he
        believed them not.

045:027 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said
        unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to
        carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:

045:028 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I
        will go and see him before I die.

046:001 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
        Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father
        Isaac.

046:002 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and
        said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

046:003 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go
        down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:

046:004 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely
        bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine
        eyes.

046:005 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel
        carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their
        wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

046:006 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had
        gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and
        all his seed with him:

046:007 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his
        sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into
        Egypt.

046:008 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
        into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

046:009 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and
        Carmi.

046:010 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and
        Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.

046:011 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

046:012 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez,
        and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the
        sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.

046:013 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and
        Shimron.

046:014 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

046:015 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in
        Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons
        and his daughters were thirty and three.

046:016 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon,
        Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.

046:017 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and
        Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber,
        and Malchiel.

046:018 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his
        daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.

046:019 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.

046:020 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and
        Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On
        bare unto him.

046:021 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,
        Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

046:022 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all
        the souls were fourteen.

046:023 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.

046:024 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and
        Shillem.

046:025 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
        daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were
        seven.

046:026 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out
        of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were
        threescore and six;

046:027 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two
        souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into
        Egypt, were threescore and ten.

046:028 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face
        unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

046:029 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel
        his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he
        fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

046:030 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen
        thy face, because thou art yet alive.

046:031 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's
        house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My
        brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of
        Canaan, are come unto me;

046:032 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed
        cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds,
        and all that they have.

046:033 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and
        shall say, What is your occupation?

046:034 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle
        from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers:
        that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is
        an abomination unto the Egyptians.

047:001 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my
        brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they
        have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they
        are in the land of Goshen.

047:002 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented
        them unto Pharaoh.

047:003 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation?
        And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both
        we, and also our fathers.

047:004 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are
        we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks;
        for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore,
        we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

047:005 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy
        brethren are come unto thee:

047:006 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make
        thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let
        them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among
        them, then make them rulers over my cattle.

047:007 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before
        Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

047:008 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?

047:009 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my
        pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have
        the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained
        unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the
        days of their pilgrimage.

047:010 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

047:011 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
        possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in
        the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

047:012 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
        father's household, with bread, according to their families.

047:013 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was
        very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of
        Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.

047:014 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the
        land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which
        they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's
        house.

047:015 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of
        Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us
        bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money
        faileth.

047:016 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for
        your cattle, if money fail.

047:017 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave
        them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for
        the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them
        with bread for all their cattle for that year.

047:018 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,
        and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that
        our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle;
        there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our
        bodies, and our lands:

047:019 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our
        land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will
        be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live,
        and not die, that the land be not desolate.

047:020 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
        Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine
        prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.

047:021 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end
        of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

047:022 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests
        had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their
        portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their
        lands.

047:023 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you
        this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you,
        and ye shall sow the land.

047:024 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give
        the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own,
        for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your
        households, and for food for your little ones.

047:025 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in
        the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

047:026 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,
        that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of
        the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.

047:027 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of
        Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and
        multiplied exceedingly.

047:028 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the
        whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

047:029 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his
        son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in
        thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal
        kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:

047:030 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
        Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will
        do as thou hast said.

047:031 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel
        bowed himself upon the bed's head.

048:001 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,
        Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,
        Manasseh and Ephraim.

048:002 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh
        unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the
        bed.

048:003 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at
        Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

048:004 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and
        multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people;
        and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an
        everlasting possession.

048:005 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born
        unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into
        Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

048:006 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be
        thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in
        their inheritance.

048:007 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in
        the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little
        way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of
        Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.

048:008 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

048:009 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God
        hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray
        thee, unto me, and I will bless them.

048:010 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not
        see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them,
        and embraced them.

048:011 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy
        face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

048:012 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he
        bowed himself with his face to the earth.

048:013 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward
        Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward
        Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.

048:014 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon
        Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon
        Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was
        the firstborn.

048:015 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers
        Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life
        long unto this day,

048:016 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and
        let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers
        Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the
        midst of the earth.

048:017 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon
        the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his
        father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto
        Manasseh's head.

048:018 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this
        is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

048:019 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know
        it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great:
        but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and
        his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

048:020 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel
        bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and
        he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

048:021 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be
        with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

048:022 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,
        which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and
        with my bow.

049:001 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves
        together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in
        the last days.

049:002 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and
        hearken unto Israel your father.

049:003 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of
        my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of
        power:

049:004 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest
        up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to
        my couch.

049:005 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in
        their habitations.

049:006 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their
        assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger
        they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a
        wall.

049:007 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for
        it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in
        Israel.

049:008 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand
        shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children
        shall bow down before thee.

049:009 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone
        up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion;
        who shall rouse him up?

049:010 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from
        between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the
        gathering of the people be.

049:011 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the
        choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes
        in the blood of grapes:

049:012 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with
        milk.

049:013 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be
        for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.

049:014 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

049:015 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was
        pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant
        unto tribute.

049:016 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

049:017 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that
        biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

049:018 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

049:019 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the
        last.

049:020 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
        dainties.

049:021 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

049:022 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;
        whose branches run over the wall:

049:023 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and
        hated him:

049:024 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were
        made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from
        thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

049:025 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the
        Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,
        blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the
        breasts, and of the womb:

049:026 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings
        of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting
        hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown
        of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

049:027 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour
        the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

049:028 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that
        their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one
        according to his blessing he blessed them.

049:029 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered
        unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in
        the field of Ephron the Hittite,

049:030 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before
        Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the
        field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a
        buryingplace.

049:031 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they
        buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

049:032 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was
        from the children of Heth.

049:033 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he
        gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost,
        and was gathered unto his people.

050:001 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and
        kissed him.

050:002 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
        father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

050:003 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled
        the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians
        mourned for him threescore and ten days.

050:004 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto
        the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in
        your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

050:005 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which
        I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou
        bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my
        father, and I will come again.

050:006 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he
        made thee swear.

050:007 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up
        all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all
        the elders of the land of Egypt,

050:008 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his
        father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and
        their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.

050:009 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it
        was a very great company.

050:010 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
        Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore
        lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.

050:011 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
        mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous
        mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called
        Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.

050:012 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:

050:013 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried
        him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham
        bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of
        Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

050:014 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all
        that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried
        his father.

050:015 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,
        they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will
        certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.

050:016 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
        command before he died, saying,

050:017 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the
        trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto
        thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the
        servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they
        spake unto him.

050:018 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and
        they said, Behold, we be thy servants.

050:019 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of
        God?

050:020 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it
        unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much
        people alive.

050:021 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little
        ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

050:022 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and
        Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.

050:023 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the
        children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up
        upon Joseph's knees.

050:024 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely
        visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which
        he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

050:025 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God
        will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from
        hence.

050:026 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
        embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

Book 02	Exodus

001:001 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
        into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

001:002 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

001:003 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

001:004 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

001:005 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were
        seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

001:006 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that
        generation.

001:007 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased
        abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and
        the land was filled with them.

001:008 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not
        Joseph.

001:009 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the
        children of Israel are more and mightier than we:

001:010 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and
        it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they
        join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get
        them up out of the land.

001:011 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them
        with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure
        cities, Pithom and Raamses.

001:012 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and
        grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

001:013 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with
        rigour:

001:014 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter,
        and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all
        their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

001:015 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which
        the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other
        Puah:

001:016 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew
        women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye
        shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

001:017 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
        commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

001:018 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto
        them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men
        children alive?

001:019 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women
        are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are
        delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.

001:020 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
        multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

001:021 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he
        made them houses.

001:022 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is
        born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall
        save alive.

002:001 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
        daughter of Levi.

002:002 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him
        that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

002:003 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an
        ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and
        put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the
        river's brink.

002:004 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to
        him.

002:005 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
        river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and
        when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to
        fetch it.

002:006 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold,
        the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This
        is one of the Hebrews' children.

002:007 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and
        call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse
        the child for thee?

002:008 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and
        called the child's mother.

002:009 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away,
        and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the
        women took the child, and nursed it.

002:010 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's
        daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name
        Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.

002:011 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that
        he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens:
        and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his
        brethren.

002:012 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that
        there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the
        sand.

002:013 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
        Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the
        wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?

002:014 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?
        intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And
        Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.

002:015 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses.
        But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land
        of Midian: and he sat down by a well.

002:016 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came
        and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's
        flock.

002:017 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up
        and helped them, and watered their flock.

002:018 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it
        that ye are come so soon to day?

002:019 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
        shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the
        flock.

002:020 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it
        that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

002:021 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
        Zipporah his daughter.

002:022 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he
        said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

002:023 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt
        died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the
        bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by
        reason of the bondage.

002:024 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
        with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

002:025 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had
        respect unto them.

003:001 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the
        priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the
        desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

003:002 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire
        out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the
        bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

003:003 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great
        sight, why the bush is not burnt.

003:004 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called
        unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses.
        And he said, Here am I.

003:005 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off
        thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

003:006 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of
        Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid
        his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.

003:007 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my
        people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason
        of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;

003:008 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the
        Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good
        land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey;
        unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
        Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
        Jebusites.

003:009 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is
        come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith
        the Egyptians oppress them.

003:010 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that
        thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out
        of Egypt.

003:011 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto
        Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel
        out of Egypt?

003:012 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be
        a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast
        brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon
        this mountain.

003:013 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children
        of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers
        hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his
        name? what shall I say unto them?

003:014 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
        shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me
        unto you.

003:015 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
        children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of
        Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me
        unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial
        unto all generations.

003:016 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto
        them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of
        Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely
        visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:

003:017 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of
        Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and
        the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
        Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

003:018 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou
        and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall
        say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us:
        and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into
        the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.

003:019 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no,
        not by a mighty hand.

003:020 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my
        wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that
        he will let you go.

003:021 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the
        Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye
        shall not go empty.

003:022 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
        sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
        and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon
        your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

004:001 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not
        believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The
        LORD hath not appeared unto thee.

004:002 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he
        said, A rod.

004:003 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the
        ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before
        it.

004:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take
        it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and
        it became a rod in his hand:

004:005 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the
        God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath
        appeared unto thee.

004:006 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand
        into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when
        he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

004:007 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put
        his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his
        bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

004:008 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee,
        neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will
        believe the voice of the latter sign.

004:009 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these
        two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt
        take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land:
        and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become
        blood upon the dry land.

004:010 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,
        neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy
        servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

004:011 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who
        maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have
        not I the LORD?

004:012 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee
        what thou shalt say.

004:013 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
        whom thou wilt send.

004:014 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he
        said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can
        speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee:
        and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.

004:015 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and
        I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach
        you what ye shall do.

004:016 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall
        be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou
        shalt be to him instead of God.

004:017 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou
        shalt do signs.

004:018 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and
        said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my
        brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet
        alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

004:019 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:
        for all the men are dead which sought thy life.

004:020 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an
        ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the
        rod of God in his hand.

004:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into
        Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh,
        which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart,
        that he shall not let the people go.

004:022 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel
        is my son, even my firstborn:

004:023 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and
        if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,
        even thy firstborn.

004:024 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met
        him, and sought to kill him.

004:025 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of
        her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody
        husband art thou to me.

004:026 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,
        because of the circumcision.

004:027 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet
        Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and
        kissed him.

004:028 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent
        him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.

004:029 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders
        of the children of Israel:

004:030 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto
        Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

004:031 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had
        visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon
        their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

005:001 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus
        saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may
        hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.

005:002 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his
        voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I
        let Israel go.

005:003 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us
        go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and
        sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with
        pestilence, or with the sword.

005:004 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses
        and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your
        burdens.

005:005 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many,
        and ye make them rest from their burdens.

005:006 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the
        people, and their officers, saying,

005:007 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as
        heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.

005:008 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye
        shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for
        they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and
        sacrifice to our God.

005:009 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
        therein; and let them not regard vain words.

005:010 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their
        officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith
        Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

005:011 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of
        your work shall be diminished.

005:012 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of
        Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

005:013 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works,
        your daily tasks, as when there was straw.

005:014 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
        taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded,
        Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both
        yesterday and to day, as heretofore?

005:015 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried
        unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy
        servants?

005:016 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us,
        Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the
        fault is in thine own people.

005:017 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let
        us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.

005:018 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given
        you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

005:019 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they
        were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish
        ought from your bricks of your daily task.

005:020 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they
        came forth from Pharaoh:

005:021 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge;
        because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of
        Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in
        their hand to slay us.

005:022 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore
        hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou
        hast sent me?

005:023 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done
        evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at
        all.

006:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will
        do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go,
        and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

006:002 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:

006:003 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by
        the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not
        known to them.

006:004 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give
        them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein
        they were strangers.

006:005 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel,
        whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my
        covenant.

006:006 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and
        I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,
        and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you
        with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:

006:007 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a
        God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which
        bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

006:008 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I
        did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I
        will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.

006:009 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they
        hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel
        bondage.

006:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:011 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the
        children of Israel go out of his land.

006:012 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children
        of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh
        hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?

006:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a
        charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of
        Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of
        Egypt.

006:014 These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of
        Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and
        Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.

006:015 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and
        Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman:
        these are the families of Simeon.

006:016 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
        generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of
        the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

006:017 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their
        families.

006:018 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and
        Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred
        thirty and three years.

006:019 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the
        families of Levi according to their generations.

006:020 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and
        she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of
        Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.

006:021 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

006:022 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

006:023 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of
        Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar,
        and Ithamar.

006:024 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these
        are the families of the Korhites.

006:025 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of
        Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads
        of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.

006:026 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring
        out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to
        their armies.

006:027 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring
        out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses
        and Aaron.

006:028 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses
        in the land of Egypt,

006:029 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak
        thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

006:030 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised
        lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

007:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to
        Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

007:002 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy
        brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of
        Israel out of his land.

007:003 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and
        my wonders in the land of Egypt.

007:004 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand
        upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the
        children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great
        judgments.

007:005 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I
        stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children
        of Israel from among them.

007:006 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did
        they.

007:007 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and
        three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

007:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

007:009 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for
        you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it
        before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

007:010 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as
        the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before
        Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

007:011 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now
        the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with
        their enchantments.

007:012 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became
        serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

007:013 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto
        them; as the LORD had said.

007:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he
        refuseth to let the people go.

007:015 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto
        the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against
        he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou
        take in thine hand.

007:016 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath
        sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may
        serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou
        wouldest not hear.

007:017 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the
        LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand
        upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be
        turned to blood.

007:018 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river
        shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the
        water of the river.

007:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod,
        and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon
        their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and
        upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and
        that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both
        in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.

007:020 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he
        lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the
        river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his
        servants; and all the waters that were in the river were
        turned to blood.

007:021 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank,
        and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river;
        and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

007:022 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
        Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto
        them; as the LORD had said.

007:023 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set
        his heart to this also.

007:024 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water
        to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

007:025 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten
        the river.

008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto
        him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may
        serve me.

008:002 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all
        thy borders with frogs:

008:003 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall
        go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and
        upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy
        people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:

008:004 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people,
        and upon all thy servants.

008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth
        thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and
        over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of
        Egypt.

008:006 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and
        the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

008:007 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought
        up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

008:008 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the
        LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my
        people; and I will let the people go, that they may do
        sacrifice unto the LORD.

008:009 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I
        intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to
        destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may
        remain in the river only?

008:010 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy
        word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the
        LORD our God.

008:011 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and
        from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in
        the river only.

008:012 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried
        unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought
        against Pharaoh.

008:013 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs
        died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the
        fields.

008:014 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land
        stank.

008:015 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his
        heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

008:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy
        rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice
        throughout all the land of Egypt.

008:017 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his
        rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in
        man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice
        throughout all the land of Egypt.

008:018 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring
        forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man,
        and upon beast.

008:019 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of
        God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not
        unto them; as the LORD had said.

008:020 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
        and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water;
        and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that
        they may serve me.

008:021 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send
        swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy
        people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians
        shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon
        they are.

008:022 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my
        people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the
        end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the
        earth.

008:023 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to
        morrow shall this sign be.

008:024 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies
        into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and
        into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason
        of the swarm of flies.

008:025 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
        sacrifice to your God in the land.

008:026 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall
        sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our
        God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians
        before their eyes, and will they not stone us?

008:027 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and
        sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.

008:028 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to
        the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very
        far away: intreat for me.

008:029 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat
        the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh,
        from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not
        Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go
        to sacrifice to the LORD.

008:030 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

008:031 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he
        removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants,
        and from his people; there remained not one.

008:032 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither
        would he let the people go.

009:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell
        him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go,
        that they may serve me.

009:002 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,

009:003 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in
        the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels,
        upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very
        grievous murrain.

009:004 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the
        cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is
        the children's of Israel.

009:005 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD
        shall do this thing in the land.

009:006 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle
        of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel
        died not one.

009:007 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle
        of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
        and he did not let the people go.

009:008 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you
        handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it
        toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

009:009 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and
        shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon
        beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

009:010 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh;
        and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil
        breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.

009:011 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the
        boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the
        Egyptians.

009:012 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened
        not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.

009:013 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
        and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the
        LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve
        me.

009:014 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart,
        and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest
        know that there is none like me in all the earth.

009:015 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and
        thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the
        earth.

009:016 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to
        shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared
        throughout all the earth.

009:017 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt
        not let them go?

009:018 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a
        very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the
        foundation thereof even until now.

009:019 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou
        hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be
        found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail
        shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

009:020 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of
        Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:

009:021 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his
        servants and his cattle in the field.

009:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
        heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon
        man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field,
        throughout the land of Egypt.

009:023 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD
        sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground;
        and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

009:024 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very
        grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of
        Egypt since it became a nation.

009:025 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that
        was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every
        herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.

009:026 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,
        was there no hail.

009:027 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said
        unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and
        I and my people are wicked.

009:028 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more
        mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye
        shall stay no longer.

009:029 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city,
        I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder
        shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou
        mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.

009:030 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet
        fear the LORD God.

009:031 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in
        the ear, and the flax was bolled.

009:032 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not
        grown up.

009:033 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad
        his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and
        the rain was not poured upon the earth.

009:034 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the
        thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his
        heart, he and his servants.

009:035 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let
        the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

010:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have
        hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I
        might shew these my signs before him:

010:002 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy
        son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs
        which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am
        the LORD.

010:003 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him,
        Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou
        refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that
        they may serve me.

010:004 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow
        will I bring the locusts into thy coast:

010:005 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be
        able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that
        which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and
        shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:

010:006 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy
        servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither
        thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day
        that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned
        himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

010:007 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man
        be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the
        LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

010:008 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he
        said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they
        that shall go?

010:009 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old,
        with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with
        our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.

010:010 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will
        let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is
        before you.

010:011 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that
        ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's
        presence.

010:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
        land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the
        land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that
        the hail hath left.

010:013 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and
        the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and
        all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought
        the locusts.

010:014 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested
        in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before
        them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them
        shall be such.

010:015 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land
        was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all
        the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there
        remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of
        the field, through all the land of Egypt.

010:016 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said,
        I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.

010:017 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
        intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this
        death only.

010:018 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

010:019 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away
        the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained
        not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.

010:020 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not
        let the children of Israel go.

010:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward
        heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt,
        even darkness which may be felt.

010:022 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there
        was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

010:023 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for
        three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their
        dwellings.

010:024 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the
        LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your
        little ones also go with you.

010:025 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
        offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.

010:026 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be
        left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our
        God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until
        we come thither.

010:027 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let
        them go.

010:028 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to
        thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my
        face thou shalt die.

010:029 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face
        again no more.

011:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more
        upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go
        hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you
        out hence altogether.

011:002 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow
        of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of
        silver and jewels of gold.

011:003 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
        Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land
        of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight
        of the people.

011:004 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go
        out into the midst of Egypt:

011:005 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the
        first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto
        the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and
        all the firstborn of beasts.

011:006 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of
        Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it
        any more.

011:007 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move
        his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that
        the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and
        Israel.

011:008 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow
        down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the
        people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he
        went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.

011:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto
        you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

011:010 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and
        the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let
        the children of Israel go out of his land.

012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
        saying,

012:002 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall
        be the first month of the year to you.

012:003 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the
        tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a
        lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an
        house:

012:004 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and
        his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the
        number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall
        make your count for the lamb.

012:005 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year:
        ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

012:006 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same
        month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel
        shall kill it in the evening.

012:007 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two
        side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein
        they shall eat it.

012:008 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire,
        and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

012:009 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast
        with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance
        thereof.

012:010 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and
        that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn
        with fire.

012:011 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes
        on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it
        in haste: it is the LORD's passover.

012:012 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will
        smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and
        beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute
        judgment: I am the LORD.

012:013 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses
        where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you,
        and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I
        smite the land of Egypt.

012:014 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall
        keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye
        shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.

012:015 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day
        ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever
        eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh
        day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

012:016 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and
        in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you;
        no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every
        man must eat, that only may be done of you.

012:017 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in
        this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land
        of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your
        generations by an ordinance for ever.

012:018 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at
        even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and
        twentieth day of the month at even.

012:019 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for
        whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall
        be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a
        stranger, or born in the land.

012:020 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall
        ye eat unleavened bread.

012:021 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto
        them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families,
        and kill the passover.

012:022 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood
        that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side
        posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you
        shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.

012:023 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and
        when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side
        posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer
        the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.

012:024 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and
        to thy sons for ever.

012:025 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which
        the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye
        shall keep this service.

012:026 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto
        you, What mean ye by this service?

012:027 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover,
        who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt,
        when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the
        people bowed the head and worshipped.

012:028 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had
        commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

012:029 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the
        firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
        that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that
        was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

012:030 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants,
        and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for
        there was not a house where there was not one dead.

012:031 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
        and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the
        children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.

012:032 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be
        gone; and bless me also.

012:033 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might
        send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all
        dead men.

012:034 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
        kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their
        shoulders.

012:035 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
        and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and
        jewels of gold, and raiment:

012:036 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
        Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they
        required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.

012:037 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
        about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside
        children.

012:038 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and
        herds, even very much cattle.

012:039 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they
        brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because
        they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither
        had they prepared for themselves any victual.

012:040 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in
        Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

012:041 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty
        years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the
        hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

012:042 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing
        them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the
        LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their
        generations.

012:043 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance
        of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:

012:044 But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou
        hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

012:045 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

012:046 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth
        ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye
        break a bone thereof.

012:047 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

012:048 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
        passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and
        then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one
        that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall
        eat thereof.

012:049 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the
        stranger that sojourneth among you.

012:050 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded
        Moses and Aaron, so did they.

012:051 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring
        the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their
        armies.

013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

013:002 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the
        womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast:
        it is mine.

013:003 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye
        came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by
        strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place:
        there shall no leavened bread be eaten.

013:004 This day came ye out in the month Abib.

013:005 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land
        of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
        Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to
        give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt
        keep this service in this month.

013:006 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh
        day shall be a feast to the LORD.

013:007 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no
        leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be
        leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.

013:008 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done
        because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth
        out of Egypt.

013:009 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for
        a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in
        thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee
        out of Egypt.

013:010 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from
        year to year.

013:011 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land
        of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers,
        and shall give it thee,

013:012 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the
        matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou
        hast; the males shall be the LORD's.

013:013 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb;
        and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his
        neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt
        thou redeem.

013:014 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
        saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By
        strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the
        house of bondage:

013:015 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that
        the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the
        firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I
        sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being
        males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.

013:016 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
        between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought
        us forth out of Egypt.

013:017 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that
        God led them not through the way of the land of the
        Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest
        peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they
        return to Egypt:

013:018 But God led the people about, through the way of the
        wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up
        harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

013:019 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had
        straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely
        visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

013:020 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in
        Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.

013:021 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud,
        to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to
        give them light; to go by day and night:

013:022 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the
        pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

014:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp
        before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against
        Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.

014:003 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are
        entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

014:004 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after
        them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his
        host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they
        did so.

014:005 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and
        the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against
        the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have
        let Israel go from serving us?

014:006 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:

014:007 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots
        of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

014:008 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
        he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of
        Israel went out with an high hand.

014:009 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and
        chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and
        overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before
        Baalzephon.

014:010 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up
        their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and
        they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out
        unto the LORD.

014:011 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in
        Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness?
        wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out
        of Egypt?

014:012 Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying,
        Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been
        better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die
        in the wilderness.

014:013 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and
        see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to
        day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see
        them again no more for ever.

014:014 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

014:015 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
        speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:

014:016 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the
        sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry
        ground through the midst of the sea.

014:017 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and
        they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh,
        and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his
        horsemen.

014:018 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have
        gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his
        horsemen.

014:019 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,
        removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went
        from before their face, and stood behind them:

014:020 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of
        Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave
        light by night to these: so that the one came not near the
        other all the night.

014:021 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD
        caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that
        night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

014:022 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon
        the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their
        right hand, and on their left.

014:023 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst
        of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his
        horsemen.

014:024 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked
        unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and
        of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,

014:025 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them
        heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face
        of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the
        Egyptians.

014:026 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
        sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon
        their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

014:027 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
        returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the
        Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the
        Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

014:028 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
        horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea
        after them; there remained not so much as one of them.

014:029 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst
        of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their
        right hand, and on their left.

014:030 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
        Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea
        shore.

014:031 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the
        Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the
        LORD, and his servant Moses.

015:001 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
        LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he
        hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he
        thrown into the sea.

015:002 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my
        salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation;
        my father's God, and I will exalt him.

015:003 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.

015:004 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his
        chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

015:005 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a
        stone.

015:006 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right
        hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

015:007 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
        them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath,
        which consumed them as stubble.

015:008 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
        together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths
        were congealed in the heart of the sea.

015:009 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide
        the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw
        my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

015:010 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank
        as lead in the mighty waters.

015:011 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like
        thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

015:012 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

015:013 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
        redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
        habitation.

015:014 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold
        on the inhabitants of Palestina.

015:015 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of
        Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants
        of Canaan shall melt away.

015:016 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine
        arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass
        over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast
        purchased.

015:017 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
        thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made
        for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy
        hands have established.

015:018 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

015:019 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with
        his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the
        waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went
        on dry land in the midst of the sea.

015:020 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel
        in her hand; and all the women went out after her with
        timbrels and with dances.

015:021 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath
        triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown
        into the sea.

015:022 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out
        into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the
        wilderness, and found no water.

015:023 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the
        waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of
        it was called Marah.

015:024 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we
        drink?

015:025 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree,
        which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made
        sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and
        there he proved them,

015:026 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the
        LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight,
        and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his
        statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I
        have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that
        healeth thee.

015:027 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
        threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the
        waters.

016:001 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the
        congregation of the children of Israel came unto the
        wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the
        fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of
        the land of Egypt.

016:002 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
        against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

016:003 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had
        died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat
        by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for
        ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this
        whole assembly with hunger.

016:004 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
        heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a
        certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they
        will walk in my law, or no.

016:005 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall
        prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as
        much as they gather daily.

016:006 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
        even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out
        from the land of Egypt:

016:007 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD;
        for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what
        are we, that ye murmur against us?

016:008 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in
        the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the
        full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye
        murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not
        against us, but against the LORD.

016:009 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of
        the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath
        heard your murmurings.

016:010 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole
        congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked
        toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD
        appeared in the cloud.

016:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

016:012 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak
        unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the
        morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that
        I am the LORD your God.

016:013 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
        covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about
        the host.

016:014 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face
        of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as
        the hoar frost on the ground.

016:015 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to
        another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses
        said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given
        you to eat.

016:016 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it
        every man according to his eating, an omer for every man,
        according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for
        them which are in his tents.

016:017 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more,
        some less.

016:018 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much
        had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack;
        they gathered every man according to his eating.

016:019 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

016:020 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of
        them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and
        stank: and Moses was wroth with them.

016:021 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
        eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

016:022 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice
        as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of
        the congregation came and told Moses.

016:023 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said,
        To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake
        that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will
        seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be
        kept until the morning.

016:024 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it
        did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.

016:025 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
        the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

016:026 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is
        the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

016:027 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on
        the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

016:028 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
        commandments and my laws?

016:029 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore
        he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye
        every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the
        seventh day.

016:030 So the people rested on the seventh day.

016:031 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it
        was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like
        wafers made with honey.

016:032 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,
        Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they
        may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness,
        when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

016:033 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
        manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for
        your generations.

016:034 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
        Testimony, to be kept.

016:035 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until
        they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they
        came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.

016:036 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

017:001 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed
        from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to
        the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and
        there was no water for the people to drink.

017:002 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
        water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide
        ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?

017:003 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people
        murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou
        hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children
        and our cattle with thirst?

017:004 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto
        this people? they be almost ready to stone me.

017:005 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and
        take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith
        thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.

017:006 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
        and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out
        of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the
        sight of the elders of Israel.

017:007 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah,
        because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because
        they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?

017:008 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

017:009 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out,
        fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the
        hill with the rod of God in mine hand.

017:010 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with
        Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the
        hill.

017:011 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
        prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

017:012 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
        under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his
        hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other
        side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the
        sun.

017:013 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
        the sword.

017:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a
        book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will
        utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

017:015 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it
        Jehovahnissi:

017:016 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will
        have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

018:001 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard
        of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people,
        and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;

018:002 Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife,
        after he had sent her back,

018:003 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom;
        for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

018:004 And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my
        father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the
        sword of Pharaoh:

018:005 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his
        wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the
        mount of God:

018:006 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come
        unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

018:007 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did
        obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their
        welfare; and they came into the tent.

018:008 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done
        unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all
        the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the
        LORD delivered them.

018:009 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had
        done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the
        Egyptians.

018:010 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you
        out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of
        Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of
        the Egyptians.

018:011 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the
        thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

018:012 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and
        sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of
        Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.

018:013 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
        people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto
        the evening.

018:014 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the
        people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the
        people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people
        stand by thee from morning unto even?

018:015 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come
        unto me to enquire of God:

018:016 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge
        between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes
        of God, and his laws.

018:017 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
        doest is not good.

018:018 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is
        with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not
        able to perform it thyself alone.

018:019 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God
        shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that
        thou mayest bring the causes unto God:

018:020 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew
        them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they
        must do.

018:021 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men,
        such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place
        such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of
        hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:

018:022 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be,
        that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every
        small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for
        thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.

018:023 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then
        thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also
        go to their place in peace.

018:024 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did
        all that he had said.

018:025 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them
        heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of
        hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

018:026 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes
        they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged
        themselves.

018:027 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way
        into his own land.

019:001 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone
        forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into
        the wilderness of Sinai.

019:002 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the
        desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there
        Israel camped before the mount.

019:003 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out
        of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of
        Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;

019:004 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you
        on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

019:005 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
        covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above
        all people: for all the earth is mine:

019:006 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy
        nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the
        children of Israel.

019:007 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and
        laid before their faces all these words which the LORD
        commanded him.

019:008 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the
        LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of
        the people unto the LORD.

019:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
        cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and
        believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people
        unto the LORD.

019:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify
        them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,

019:011 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD
        will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount
        Sinai.

019:012 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,
        Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or
        touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be
        surely put to death:

019:013 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be
        stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall
        not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up
        to the mount.

019:014 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and
        sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.

019:015 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:
        come not at your wives.

019:016 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that
        there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the
        mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that
        all the people that was in the camp trembled.

019:017 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet
        with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

019:018 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD
        descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as
        the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

019:019 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed
        louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a
        voice.

019:020 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the
        mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount;
        and Moses went up.

019:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest
        they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them
        perish.

019:022 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD,
        sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.

019:023 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to
        mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about
        the mount, and sanctify it.

019:024 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou
        shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the
        priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD,
        lest he break forth upon them.

019:025 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

020:001 And God spake all these words, saying,

020:002 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land
        of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

020:003 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

020:004 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
        likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in
        the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

020:005 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I
        the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
        the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
        generation of them that hate me;

020:006 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
        keep my commandments.

020:007 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for
        the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
        vain.

020:008 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

020:009 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

020:010 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it
        thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
        daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle,
        nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

020:011 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
        all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the
        LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

020:012 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long
        upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

020:013 Thou shalt not kill.

020:014 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

020:015 Thou shalt not steal.

020:016 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

020:017 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not
        covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his
        maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is
        thy neighbour's.

020:018 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings,
        and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and
        when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

020:019 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will
        hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

020:020 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to
        prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye
        sin not.

020:021 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the
        thick darkness where God was.

020:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the
        children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you
        from heaven.

020:023 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye
        make unto you gods of gold.

020:024 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
        thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy
        sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I
        will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

020:025 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not
        build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it,
        thou hast polluted it.

020:026 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy
        nakedness be not discovered thereon.

021:001 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

021:002 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and
        in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

021:003 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he
        were married, then his wife shall go out with him.

021:004 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him
        sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her
        master's, and he shall go out by himself.

021:005 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my
        wife, and my children; I will not go out free:

021:006 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also
        bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master
        shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him
        for ever.

021:007 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall
        not go out as the menservants do.

021:008 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to
        himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a
        strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt
        deceitfully with her.

021:009 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with
        her after the manner of daughters.

021:010 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her
        duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.

021:011 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out
        free without money.

021:012 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to
        death.

021:013 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his
        hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

021:014 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay
        him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he
        may die.

021:015 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely
        put to death.

021:016 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found
        in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

021:017 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be
        put to death.

021:018 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a
        stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:

021:019 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall
        he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of
        his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.

021:020 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and
        he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

021:021 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be
        punished: for he is his money.

021:022 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit
        depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be
        surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay
        upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.

021:023 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for
        life,

021:024 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

021:025 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

021:026 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his
        maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's
        sake.

021:027 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his
        maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's
        sake.

021:028 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox
        shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but
        the owner of the ox shall be quit.

021:029 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past,
        and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept
        him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall
        be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.

021:030 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for
        the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

021:031 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter,
        according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.

021:032 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall
        give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox
        shall be stoned.

021:033 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit,
        and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;

021:034 The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto
        the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.

021:035 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they
        shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the
        dead ox also they shall divide.

021:036 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,
        and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for
        ox; and the dead shall be his own.

022:001 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell
        it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a
        sheep.

022:002 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,
        there shall no blood be shed for him.

022:003 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for
        him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing,
        then he shall be sold for his theft.

022:004 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it
        be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.

022:005 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and
        shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field;
        of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own
        vineyard, shall he make restitution.

022:006 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of
        corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed
        therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make
        restitution.

022:007 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to
        keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be
        found, let him pay double.

022:008 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall
        be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his
        hand unto his neighbour's goods.

022:009 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for
        sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which
        another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall
        come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he
        shall pay double unto his neighbour.

022:010 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a
        sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or
        driven away, no man seeing it:

022:011 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he
        hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the
        owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it
        good.

022:012 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto
        the owner thereof.

022:013 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness,
        and he shall not make good that which was torn.

022:014 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or
        die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make
        it good.

022:015 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it
        good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.

022:016 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with
        her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

022:017 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall
        pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

022:018 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

022:019 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

022:020 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he
        shall be utterly destroyed.

022:021 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye
        were strangers in the land of Egypt.

022:022 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

022:023 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me,
        I will surely hear their cry;

022:024 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the
        sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children
        fatherless.

022:025 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,
        thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay
        upon him usury.

022:026 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou
        shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

022:027 For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin:
        wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he
        crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

022:028 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy
        people.

022:029 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits,
        and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give
        unto me.

022:030 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep:
        seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou
        shalt give it me.

022:031 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any
        flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to
        the dogs.

023:001 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with
        the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

023:002 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt
        thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:

023:003 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

023:004 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou
        shalt surely bring it back to him again.

023:005 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his
        burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely
        help with him.

023:006 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

023:007 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and
        righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

023:008 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise,
        and perverteth the words of the righteous.

023:009 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart
        of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

023:010 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the
        fruits thereof:

023:011 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still;
        that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the
        beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal
        with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.

023:012 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou
        shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son
        of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

023:013 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect:
        and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it
        be heard out of thy mouth.

023:014 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

023:015 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat
        unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time
        appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from
        Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)

023:016 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours,
        which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of
        ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast
        gathered in thy labours out of the field.

023:017 Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the
        LORD God.

023:018 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened
        bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the
        morning.

023:019 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into
        the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in
        his mother's milk.

023:020 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,
        and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

023:021 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he
        will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

023:022 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I
        speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an
        adversary unto thine adversaries.

023:023 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto
        the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the
        Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut
        them off.

023:024 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do
        after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and
        quite break down their images.

023:025 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy
        bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the
        midst of thee.

023:026 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy
        land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.

023:027 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the
        people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine
        enemies turn their backs unto thee.

023:028 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the
        Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

023:029 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest
        the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply
        against thee.

023:030 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,
        until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

023:031 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea
        of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I
        will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and
        thou shalt drive them out before thee.

023:032 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

023:033 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin
        against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a
        snare unto thee.

024:001 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and
        Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel;
        and worship ye afar off.

024:002 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not
        come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

024:003 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD,
        and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one
        voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will
        we do.

024:004 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early
        in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and
        twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

024:005 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered
        burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto
        the LORD.

024:006 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and
        half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

024:007 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience
        of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will
        we do, and be obedient.

024:008 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and
        said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath
        made with you concerning all these words.

024:009 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy
        of the elders of Israel:

024:010 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet
        as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were
        the body of heaven in his clearness.

024:011 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his
        hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.

024:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount,
        and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law,
        and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach
        them.

024:013 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up
        into the mount of God.

024:014 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we
        come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you:
        if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

024:015 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the
        mount.

024:016 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the
        cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto
        Moses out of the midst of the cloud.

024:017 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire
        on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

024:018 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up
        into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and
        forty nights.

025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an
        offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart
        ye shall take my offering.

025:003 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold,
        and silver, and brass,

025:004 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
        hair,

025:005 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
        wood,

025:006 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet
        incense,

025:007 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the
        breastplate.

025:008 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.

025:009 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the
        tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof,
        even so shall ye make it.

025:010 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a
        half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
        breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

025:011 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without
        shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold
        round about.

025:012 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in
        the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one
        side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.

025:013 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them
        with gold.

025:014 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of
        the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.

025:015 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be
        taken from it.

025:016 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall
        give thee.

025:017 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and
        a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
        breadth thereof.

025:018 And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work
        shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.

025:019 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on
        the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the
        cherubims on the two ends thereof.

025:020 And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high,
        covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces
        shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the
        faces of the cherubims be.

025:021 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in
        the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

025:022 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee
        from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims
        which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I
        will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

025:023 Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall
        be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a
        cubit and a half the height thereof.

025:024 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a
        crown of gold round about.

025:025 And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round
        about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border
        thereof round about.

025:026 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the
        rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

025:027 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the
        staves to bear the table.

025:028 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay
        them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

025:029 And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof,
        and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of
        pure gold shalt thou make them.

025:030 And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.

025:031 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work
        shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches,
        his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.

025:032 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three
        branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three
        branches of the candlestick out of the other side:

025:033 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower
        in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other
        branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that
        come out of the candlestick.

025:034 And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto
        almonds, with their knops and their flowers.

025:035 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and
        a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two
        branches of the same, according to the six branches that
        proceed out of the candlestick.

025:036 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it
        shall be one beaten work of pure gold.

025:037 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall
        light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against
        it.

025:038 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be
        of pure gold.

025:039 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these
        vessels.

025:040 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was
        shewed thee in the mount.

026:001 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of
        fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with
        cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.

026:002 The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits,
        and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of
        the curtains shall have one measure.

026:003 The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another;
        and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another.

026:004 And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one
        curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt
        thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the
        coupling of the second.

026:005 Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty
        loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in
        the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one
        of another.

026:006 And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the
        curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one
        tabernacle.

026:007 And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering
        upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.

026:008 The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the
        breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains
        shall be all of one measure.

026:009 And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six
        curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in
        the forefront of the tabernacle.

026:010 And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain
        that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge
        of the curtain which coupleth the second.

026:011 And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches
        into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be
        one.

026:012 And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent,
        the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside
        of the tabernacle.

026:013 And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of
        that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the
        tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this
        side and on that side, to cover it.

026:014 And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins
        dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.

026:015 And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood
        standing up.

026:016 Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a
        half shall be the breadth of one board.

026:017 Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one
        against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of
        the tabernacle.

026:018 And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty
        boards on the south side southward.

026:019 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty
        boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and
        two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

026:020 And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side
        there shall be twenty boards:

026:021 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
        board, and two sockets under another board.

026:022 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make
        six boards.

026:023 And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the
        tabernacle in the two sides.

026:024 And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be
        coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus
        shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.

026:025 And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver,
        sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets
        under another board.

026:026 And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards
        of the one side of the tabernacle,

026:027 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
        tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the
        tabernacle, for the two sides westward.

026:028 And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from
        end to end.

026:029 And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their
        rings of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay
        the bars with gold.

026:030 And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion
        thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.

026:031 And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet,
        and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it
        be made:

026:032 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood
        overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the
        four sockets of silver.

026:033 And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou
        mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the
        testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy
        place and the most holy.

026:034 And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the
        testimony in the most holy place.

026:035 And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the
        candlestick over against the table on the side of the
        tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on
        the north side.

026:036 And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of
        blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought
        with needlework.

026:037 And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim
        wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of
        gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.

027:001 And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits
        long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare:
        and the height thereof shall be three cubits.

027:002 And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners
        thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt
        overlay it with brass.

027:003 And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his
        shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans:
        all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass.

027:004 And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and
        upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four
        corners thereof.

027:005 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath,
        that the net may be even to the midst of the altar.

027:006 And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim
        wood, and overlay them with brass.

027:007 And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves
        shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.

027:008 Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee
        in the mount, so shall they make it.

027:009 And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south
        side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine

        ten.

        and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall
        be of brass.

027:020 And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring
        thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to
        burn always.

027:021 In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which
        is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it
        from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute
        for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children
        of Israel.

028:001 And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
        him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister
        unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu,
        Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.

028:002 And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for
        glory and for beauty.

028:003 And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I
        have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make
        Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto
        me in the priest's office.

028:004 And these are the garments which they shall make; a
        breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a
        mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for
        Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me
        in the priest's office.

028:005 And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,
        and fine linen.

028:006 And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple,
        of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.

028:007 It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two
        edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.

028:008 And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall
        be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold,
        of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

028:009 And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the
        names of the children of Israel:

028:010 Six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of
        the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.

028:011 With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of
        a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of
        the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in
        ouches of gold.

028:012 And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the
        ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and
        Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two
        shoulders for a memorial.

028:013 And thou shalt make ouches of gold;

028:014 And two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work
        shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the
        ouches.

028:015 And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning
        work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold,
        of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined
        linen, shalt thou make it.

028:016 Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the
        length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.

028:017 And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of
        stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a
        carbuncle: this shall be the first row.

028:018 And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a
        diamond.

028:019 And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

028:020 And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they
        shall be set in gold in their inclosings.

028:021 And the stones shall be with the names of the children of
        Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings
        of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according
        to the twelve tribes.

028:022 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of
        wreathen work of pure gold.

028:023 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold,
        and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the
        breastplate.

028:024 And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two
        rings which are on the ends of the breastplate.

028:025 And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt
        fasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces
        of the ephod before it.

028:026 And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them
        upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof,
        which is in the side of the ephod inward.

028:027 And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put
        them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the
        forepart thereof, over against the other coupling thereof,
        above the curious girdle of the ephod.

028:028 And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto
        the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be
        above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the
        breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.

028:029 And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in
        the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in
        unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD
        continually.

028:030 And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and
        the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he
        goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of
        the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD
        continually.

028:031 And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.

028:032 And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst
        thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the
        hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be
        not rent.

028:033 And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of
        blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem
        thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:

028:034 A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a
        pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.

028:035 And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be
        heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD,
        and when he cometh out, that he die not.

028:036 And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it,
        like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

028:037 And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the
        mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.

028:038 And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the
        iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel
        shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always
        upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.

028:039 And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou
        shalt make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the
        girdle of needlework.

028:040 And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt
        make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them,
        for glory and for beauty.

028:041 And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons
        with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and
        sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's
        office.

028:042 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their
        nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall
        reach:

028:043 And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they
        come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they
        come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that
        they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for
        ever unto him and his seed after him.

029:001 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow
        them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one
        young bullock, and two rams without blemish,

029:002 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil,
        and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour
        shalt thou make them.

029:003 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the
        basket, with the bullock and the two rams.

029:004 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with
        water.

029:005 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat,
        and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate,
        and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:

029:006 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy
        crown upon the mitre.

029:007 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his
        head, and anoint him.

029:008 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.

029:009 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and
        put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be
        theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate
        Aaron and his sons.

029:010 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the
        tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall
        put their hands upon the head of the bullock.

029:011 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door
        of the tabernacle of the congregation.

029:012 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it
        upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the
        blood beside the bottom of the altar.

029:013 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and
        the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the
        fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

029:014 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung,
        shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin
        offering.

029:015 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put
        their hands upon the head of the ram.

029:016 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood,
        and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

029:017 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of
        him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his
        head.

029:018 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a
        burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an
        offering made by fire unto the LORD.

029:019 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons
        shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

029:020 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put
        it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of
        the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right
        hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle
        the blood upon the altar round about.

029:021 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and
        of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his
        garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons
        with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his
        sons, and his sons' garments with him.

029:022 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the
        fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver,
        and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the
        right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:

029:023 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one
        wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before
        the LORD:

029:024 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands
        of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before
        the LORD.

029:025 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon
        the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the
        LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

029:026 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's
        consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD:
        and it shall be thy part.

029:027 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and
        the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which
        is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that
        which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:

029:028 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever
        from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and
        it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of
        the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave
        offering unto the LORD.

029:029 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him,
        to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

029:030 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on
        seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the
        congregation to minister in the holy place.

029:031 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe
        his flesh in the holy place.

029:032 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the
        bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of
        the congregation.

029:033 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was
        made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall
        not eat thereof, because they are holy.

029:034 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the
        bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the
        remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is
        holy.

029:035 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according
        to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt
        thou consecrate them.

029:036 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering
        for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou
        hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to
        sanctify it.

029:037 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and
        sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever
        toucheth the altar shall be holy.

029:038 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two
        lambs of the first year day by day continually.

029:039 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other
        lamb thou shalt offer at even:

029:040 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the
        fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an
        hin of wine for a drink offering.

029:041 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do
        thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and
        according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour,
        an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

029:042 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your
        generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
        before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto
        thee.

029:043 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the
        tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

029:044 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and
        the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to
        minister to me in the priest's office.

029:045 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be
        their God.

029:046 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought
        them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among
        them: I am the LORD their God.

030:001 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim
        wood shalt thou make it.

030:002 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth
        thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the
        height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.

030:003 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and
        the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou
        shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.

030:004 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of
        it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt
        thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to
        bear it withal.

030:005 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay
        them with gold.

030:006 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of
        the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the
        testimony, where I will meet with thee.

030:007 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when
        he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

030:008 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn
        incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD
        throughout your generations.

030:009 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt
        sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink
        offering thereon.

030:010 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in
        a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once
        in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your
        generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.

030:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

030:012 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their
        number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul
        unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no
        plague among them, when thou numberest them.

030:013 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that
        are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary:
        (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the
        offering of the LORD.

030:014 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from
        twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the
        LORD.

030:015 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less
        than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD,
        to make an atonement for your souls.

030:016 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of
        Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle
        of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the
        children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for
        your souls.

030:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

030:018 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of
        brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the
        tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt
        put water therein.

030:019 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
        thereat:

030:020 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they
        shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come
        near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire
        unto the LORD:

030:021 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die
        not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him
        and to his seed throughout their generations.

030:022 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

030:023 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five
        hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two
        hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred
        and fifty shekels,

030:024 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the
        sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:

030:025 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment
        compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy
        anointing oil.

030:026 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation
        therewith, and the ark of the testimony,

030:027 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his
        vessels, and the altar of incense,

030:028 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the
        laver and his foot.

030:029 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:
        whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

030:030 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,
        that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

030:031 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This
        shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your
        generations.

030:032 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make
        any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy,
        and it shall be holy unto you.

030:033 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of
        it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

030:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,
        stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure
        frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:

030:035 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art
        of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:

030:036 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it
        before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation,
        where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

030:037 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not
        make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it
        shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.

030:038 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall
        even be cut off from his people.

031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

031:002 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of
        Hur, of the tribe of Judah:

031:003 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and
        in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
        workmanship,

031:004 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and
        in brass,

031:005 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
        timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

031:006 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of
        Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that
        are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all
        that I have commanded thee;

031:007 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the
        testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the
        furniture of the tabernacle,

031:008 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with
        all his furniture, and the altar of incense,

031:009 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and
        the laver and his foot,

031:010 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the
        priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the
        priest's office,

031:011 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place:
        according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

031:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

031:013 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my
        sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you
        throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the
        LORD that doth sanctify you.

031:014 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:
        every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for
        whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off
        from among his people.

031:015 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath
        of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the
        sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

031:016 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to
        observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a
        perpetual covenant.

031:017 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever:
        for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the
        seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

031:018 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing
        with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of
        stone, written with the finger of God.

032:001 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of
        the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron,
        and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us;
        for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
        land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

032:002 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which
        are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your
        daughters, and bring them unto me.

032:003 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in
        their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

032:004 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a
        graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they
        said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out
        of the land of Egypt.

032:005 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron
        made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.

032:006 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt
        offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat
        down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.

032:007 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy
        people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have
        corrupted themselves:

032:008 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I
        commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have
        worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These
        be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the
        land of Egypt.

032:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,
        behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

032:010 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against
        them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a
        great nation.

032:011 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth
        thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought
        forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a
        mighty hand?

032:012 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief
        did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to
        consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce
        wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.

032:013 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom
        thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will
        multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land
        that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they
        shall inherit it for ever.

032:014 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto
        his people.

032:015 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
        tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were
        written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other
        were they written.

032:016 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the
        writing of God, graven upon the tables.

032:017 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
        he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

032:018 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for
        mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being
        overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.

032:019 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp,
        that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed
        hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them
        beneath the mount.

032:020 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the
        fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water,
        and made the children of Israel drink of it.

032:021 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee,
        that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?

032:022 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou
        knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.

032:023 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:
        for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
        land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

032:024 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break
        it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and
        there came out this calf.

032:025 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had
        made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)

032:026 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on
        the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of
        Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

032:027 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put
        every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate
        to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother,
        and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.

032:028 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses:
        and there fell of the people that day about three thousand
        men.

032:029 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,
        even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may
        bestow upon you a blessing this day.

032:030 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the
        people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto
        the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.

032:031 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people
        have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

032:032 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot
        me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.

032:033 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against
        me, him will I blot out of my book.

032:034 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I
        have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before
        thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their
        sin upon them.

032:035 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,
        which Aaron made.

033:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou
        and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of
        Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and
        to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:

033:002 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the
        Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite,
        the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

033:003 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up
        in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest
        I consume thee in the way.

033:004 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned:
        and no man did put on him his ornaments.

033:005 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of
        Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the
        midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put
        off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto
        thee.

033:006 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their
        ornaments by the mount Horeb.

033:007 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the
        camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of
        the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which
        sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the
        congregation, which was without the camp.

033:008 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
        that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent
        door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the
        tabernacle.

033:009 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the
        cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the
        tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.

033:010 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the
        tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped,
        every man in his tent door.

033:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh
        unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his
        servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out
        of the tabernacle.

033:012 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring
        up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt
        send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and
        thou hast also found grace in my sight.

033:013 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy
        sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may
        find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy
        people.

033:014 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give
        thee rest.

033:015 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us
        not up hence.

033:016 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
        found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with
        us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the
        people that are upon the face of the earth.

033:017 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that
        thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I
        know thee by name.

033:018 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

033:019 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and
        I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be
        gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on
        whom I will shew mercy.

033:020 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no
        man see me, and live.

033:021 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou
        shalt stand upon a rock:

033:022 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I
        will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with
        my hand while I pass by:

033:023 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back
        parts: but my face shall not be seen.

034:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone
        like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the
        words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.

034:002 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
        mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the
        mount.

034:003 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be
        seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor
        herds feed before that mount.

034:004 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and
        Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount
        Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the
        two tables of stone.

034:005 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
        and proclaimed the name of the LORD.

034:006 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD,
        The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and
        abundant in goodness and truth,

034:007 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
        transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the
        guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
        children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and
        to the fourth generation.

034:008 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
        worshipped.

034:009 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD,
        let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked
        people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for
        thine inheritance.

034:010 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people
        I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the
        earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou
        art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing
        that I will do with thee.

034:011 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I
        drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the
        Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

034:012 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
        inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a
        snare in the midst of thee:

034:013 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut
        down their groves:

034:014 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name
        is Jealous, is a jealous God:

034:015 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land,
        and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto
        their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;

034:016 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their
        daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go
        a whoring after their gods.

034:017 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

034:018 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou
        shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time
        of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from
        Egypt.

034:019 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among
        thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

034:020 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and
        if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All
        the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall
        appear before me empty.

034:021 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt
        rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

034:022 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits
        of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's
        end.

034:023 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before
        the LORD God, the God of Israel.

034:024 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
        borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou
        shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the
        year.

034:025 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
        neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be
        left unto the morning.

034:026 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto
        the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in
        his mother's milk.

034:027 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for
        after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with
        thee and with Israel.

034:028 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he
        did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the
        tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

034:029 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai
        with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came
        down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his
        face shone while he talked with him.

034:030 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses,
        behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to
        come nigh him.

034:031 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of
        the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with
        them.

034:032 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he
        gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him
        in mount Sinai.

034:033 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on
        his face.

034:034 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he
        took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and
        spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

034:035 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the
        skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his
        face again, until he went in to speak with him.

035:001 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of
        Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which
        the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.

035:002 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there
        shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD:
        whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.

035:003 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
        sabbath day.

035:004 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of
        Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded,
        saying,

035:005 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is
        of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD;
        gold, and silver, and brass,

035:006 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
        hair,

035:007 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
        wood,

035:008 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for
        the sweet incense,

035:009 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for
        the breastplate.

035:010 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that
        the LORD hath commanded;

035:011 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and
        his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,

035:012 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the
        vail of the covering,

035:013 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the
        shewbread,

035:014 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his
        lamps, with the oil for the light,

035:015 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,
        and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the
        entering in of the tabernacle,

035:016 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his
        staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,

035:017 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and
        the hanging for the door of the court,

035:018 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and
        their cords,

035:019 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the
        holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his
        sons, to minister in the priest's office.

035:020 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed
        from the presence of Moses.

035:021 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every
        one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's
        offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation,
        and for all his service, and for the holy garments.

035:022 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing
        hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and
        tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered
        offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.

035:023 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and
        scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of
        rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

035:024 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass
        brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was
        found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

035:025 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their
        hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and
        of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

035:026 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
        goats' hair.

035:027 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for
        the ephod, and for the breastplate;

035:028 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil,
        and for the sweet incense.

035:029 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the
        LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to
        bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to
        be made by the hand of Moses.

035:030 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath
        called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the
        tribe of Judah;

035:031 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in
        understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
        workmanship;

035:032 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver,
        and in brass,

035:033 And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
        wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

035:034 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and
        Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

035:035 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner
        of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of
        the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in
        fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work,
        and of those that devise cunning work.

036:001 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man,
        in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to
        work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary,
        according to all that the LORD had commanded.

036:002 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted
        man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one
        whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:

036:003 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the
        children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of
        the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto
        him free offerings every morning.

036:004 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the
        sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;

036:005 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more
        than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD
        commanded to make.

036:006 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be
        proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor
        woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So
        the people were restrained from bringing.

036:007 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
        it, and too much.

036:008 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of
        the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and
        blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work
        made he them.

036:009 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
        breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of
        one size.

036:010 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the
        other five curtains he coupled one unto another.

036:011 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
        selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost
        side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

036:012 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in
        the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the
        second: the loops held one curtain to another.

036:013 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one
        unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

036:014 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the
        tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

036:015 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits
        was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of
        one size.

036:016 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains
        by themselves.

036:017 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain
        in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the
        curtain which coupleth the second.

036:018 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,
        that it might be one.

036:019 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,
        and a covering of badgers' skins above that.

036:020 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood,
        standing up.

036:021 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a
        board one cubit and a half.

036:022 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another:
        thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

036:023 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the
        south side southward:

036:024 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards;
        two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two
        sockets under another board for his two tenons.

036:025 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the
        north corner, he made twenty boards,

036:026 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
        board, and two sockets under another board.

036:027 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six
        boards.

036:028 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in
        the two sides.

036:029 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the
        head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both
        the corners.

036:030 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen
        sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.

036:031 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the
        one side of the tabernacle,

036:032 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
        tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for
        the sides westward.

036:033 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from
        the one end to the other.

036:034 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of
        gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with
        gold.

036:035 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
        twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

036:036 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and
        overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast
        for them four sockets of silver.

036:037 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and
        purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;

036:038 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid
        their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five
        sockets were of brass.

037:001 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a
        half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth
        of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:

037:002 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made
        a crown of gold to it round about.

037:003 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four
        corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two
        rings upon the other side of it.

037:004 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
        gold.

037:005 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark,
        to bear the ark.

037:006 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half
        was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth
        thereof.

037:007 And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece
        made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;

037:008 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the
        other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the
        cherubims on the two ends thereof.

037:009 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered
        with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to
        another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the
        cherubims.

037:010 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the
        length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit
        and a half the height thereof:

037:011 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown
        of gold round about.

037:012 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;
        and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

037:013 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon
        the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

037:014 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the
        staves to bear the table.

037:015 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
        gold, to bear the table.

037:016 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes,
        and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal,
        of pure gold.

037:017 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made
        he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his
        knops, and his flowers, were of the same:

037:018 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three
        branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and
        three branches of the candlestick out of the other side
        thereof:

037:019 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a
        knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in
        another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six
        branches going out of the candlestick.

037:020 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his
        knops, and his flowers:

037:021 And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under
        two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the
        same, according to the six branches going out of it.

037:022 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was
        one beaten work of pure gold.

037:023 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his
        snuffdishes, of pure gold.

037:024 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels
        thereof.

037:025 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of
        it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was
        foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns
        thereof were of the same.

037:026 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the
        sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made
        unto it a crown of gold round about.

037:027 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof,
        by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be
        places for the staves to bear it withal.

037:028 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
        gold.

037:029 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of
        sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

038:001 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five
        cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth
        thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height
        thereof.

038:002 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the
        horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.

038:003 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the
        shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans:
        all the vessels thereof made he of brass.

038:004 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the
        compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.

038:005 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of
        brass, to be places for the staves.

038:006 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
        brass.

038:007 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the
        altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with
        boards.

038:008 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass,
        of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled
        at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

038:009 And he made the court: on the south side southward the
        hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred
        cubits:

038:010 Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty;
        the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

038:011 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits,
        their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty;
        the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.

038:012 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their
        pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars
        and their fillets of silver.

038:013 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.

038:014 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits;
        their pillars three, and their sockets three.

038:015 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and
        that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars
        three, and their sockets three.

038:016 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined
        linen.

038:017 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of
        the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of
        their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court
        were filleted with silver.

038:018 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of
        blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and
        twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth
        was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.

038:019 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four;
        their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters
        and their fillets of silver.

038:020 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round
        about, were of brass.

038:021 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of
        testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of
        Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar,
        son to Aaron the priest.

038:022 And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of
        Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.

038:023 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of
        Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in
        blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

038:024 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of
        the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and
        nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the
        shekel of the sanctuary.

038:025 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation
        was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and
        threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the
        sanctuary:

038:026 A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the
        shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be
        numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred
        thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.

038:027 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of
        the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets
        of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

038:028 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he
        made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and
        filleted them.

038:029 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two
        thousand and four hundred shekels.

038:030 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the
        brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,

038:031 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of
        the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all
        the pins of the court round about.

039:001 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of
        service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy
        garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.

039:002 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet,
        and fine twined linen.

039:003 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into
        wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the
        scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.

039:004 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the
        two edges was it coupled together.

039:005 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of
        the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and
        purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

039:006 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold,
        graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children
        of Israel.

039:007 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they
        should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as
        the LORD commanded Moses.

039:008 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of
        the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
        twined linen.

039:009 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span
        was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being
        doubled.

039:010 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a
        sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

039:011 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

039:012 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

039:013 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were
        inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

039:014 And the stones were according to the names of the children of
        Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings
        of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve
        tribes.

039:015 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of
        wreathen work of pure gold.

039:016 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put
        the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

039:017 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings
        on the ends of the breastplate.

039:018 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in
        the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the
        ephod, before it.

039:019 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends
        of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the
        side of the ephod inward.

039:020 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two
        sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over
        against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle
        of the ephod.

039:021 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings
        of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the
        curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might
        not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.

039:022 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

039:023 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of
        an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should
        not rend.

039:024 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,
        and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

039:025 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between
        the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between
        the pomegranates;

039:026 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round
        about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

039:027 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and
        for his sons,

039:028 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen,
        and linen breeches of fine twined linen,

039:029 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
        scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

039:030 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and
        wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet,
        HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

039:031 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high
        upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.

039:032 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the
        congregation finished: and the children of Israel did
        according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

039:033 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all
        his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his
        pillars, and his sockets,

039:034 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of
        badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,

039:035 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the
        mercy seat,

039:036 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,

039:037 The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the
        lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the
        oil for light,

039:038 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet
        incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,

039:039 The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all
        his vessels, the laver and his foot,

039:040 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and
        the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and
        all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent
        of the congregation,

039:041 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the
        holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to
        minister in the priest's office.

039:042 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the
        children of Israel made all the work.

039:043 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had
        done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it:
        and Moses blessed them.

040:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

040:002 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the
        tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

040:003 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover
        the ark with the vail.

040:004 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things
        that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in
        the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

040:005 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before
        the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to
        the tabernacle.

040:006 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the
        door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

040:007 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the
        congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.

040:008 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the
        hanging at the court gate.

040:009 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the
        tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and
        all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.

040:010 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all
        his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar
        most holy.

040:011 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

040:012 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

040:013 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint
        him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the
        priest's office.

040:014 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:

040:015 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father,
        that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for
        their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood
        throughout their generations.

040:016 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him,
        so did he.

040:017 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
        the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

040:018 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
        and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof,
        and reared up his pillars.

040:019 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
        covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

040:020 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
        staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:

040:021 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the
        vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as
        the LORD commanded Moses.

040:022 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the
        side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

040:023 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the
        LORD had commanded Moses.

040:024 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation,
        over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle
        southward.

040:025 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

040:026 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation
        before the vail:

040:027 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

040:028 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

040:029 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the
        tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon
        it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

040:030 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
        the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

040:031 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their
        feet thereat:

040:032 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when
        they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

040:033 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
        altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses
        finished the work.

040:034 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the
        glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

040:035 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
        congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory
        of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

040:036 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
        children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:

040:037 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not
        till the day that it was taken up.

040:038 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and
        fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of
        Israel, throughout all their journeys.

Book 03	Leviticus

001:001 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

001:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
        man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring
        your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the
        flock.

001:003 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him
        offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own
        voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation before the LORD.

001:004 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering;
        and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

001:005 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the
        priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the
        blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation.

001:006 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his
        pieces.

001:007 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the
        altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:

001:008 And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head,
        and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which
        is upon the altar:

001:009 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the
        priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice,
        an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

001:010 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or
        of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male
        without blemish.

001:011 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before
        the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his
        blood round about upon the altar.

001:012 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his
        fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that
        is on the fire which is upon the altar:

001:013 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the
        priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a
        burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
        unto the LORD.

001:014 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of
        fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of
        young pigeons.

001:015 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off
        his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof
        shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:

001:016 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast
        it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the
        ashes:

001:017 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not
        divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the
        altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt
        sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
        the LORD.

002:001 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his
        offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon
        it, and put frankincense thereon:

002:002 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he
        shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of
        the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the
        priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an
        offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:

002:003 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his
        sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD
        made by fire.

002:004 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the
        oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with
        oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

002:005 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it
        shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

002:006 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a
        meat offering.

002:007 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan,
        it shall be made of fine flour with oil.

002:008 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these
        things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the
        priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.

002:009 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
        thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering
        made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

002:010 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's
        and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the
        LORD made by fire.

002:011 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be
        made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey,
        in any offering of the LORD made by fire.

002:012 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them
        unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a
        sweet savour.

002:013 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with
        salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of
        thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine
        offerings thou shalt offer salt.

002:014 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
        LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy
        firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn
        beaten out of full ears.

002:015 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon:
        it is a meat offering.

002:016 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the
        beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the
        frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the
        LORD.

003:001 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he
        offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall
        offer it without blemish before the LORD.

003:002 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and
        kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and
        Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the
        altar round about.

003:003 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
        offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the
        inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

003:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by
        the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it
        shall he take away.

003:005 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt
        sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is
        an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

003:006 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the
        LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it
        without blemish.

003:007 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it
        before the LORD.

003:008 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and
        kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's
        sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the
        altar.

003:009 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
        offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the
        whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the
        fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon
        the inwards,

003:010 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
        by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
        it shall he take away.

003:011 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of
        the offering made by fire unto the LORD.

003:012 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before
        the LORD.

003:013 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it
        before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of
        Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round
        about.

003:014 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made
        by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and
        all the fat that is upon the inwards,

003:015 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
        by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
        it shall he take away.

003:016 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food
        of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat
        is the LORD's.

003:017 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations
        throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor
        blood.

004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

004:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin
        through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD
        concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do
        against any of them:

004:003 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of
        the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath
        sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a
        sin offering.

004:004 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle
        of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand
        upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.

004:005 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's
        blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:

004:006 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle
        of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of
        the sanctuary.

004:007 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of
        the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the
        tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood
        of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt
        offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

004:008 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for
        the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all
        the fat that is upon the inwards,

004:009 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
        by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
        it shall he take away,

004:010 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace
        offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of
        the burnt offering.

004:011 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,
        and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,

004:012 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp
        unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn
        him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out
        shall he be burnt.

004:013 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,
        and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they
        have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD
        concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;

004:014 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known,
        then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin,
        and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:015 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon
        the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall
        be killed before the LORD.

004:016 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's
        blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:

004:017 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and
        sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.

004:018 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
        which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom
        of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:019 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the
        altar.

004:020 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock
        for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest
        shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven
        them.

004:021 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and
        burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering
        for the congregation.

004:022 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance
        against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning
        things which should not be done, and is guilty;

004:023 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge;
        he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male
        without blemish:

004:024 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill
        it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the
        LORD: it is a sin offering.

004:025 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
        with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
        burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of
        the altar of burnt offering.

004:026 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of
        the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an
        atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be
        forgiven him.

004:027 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance,
        while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the
        LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be
        guilty;

004:028 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge:
        then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female
        without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.

004:029 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
        and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

004:030 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his
        finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt
        offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the
        bottom of the altar.

004:031 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is
        taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the
        priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto
        the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and
        it shall be forgiven him.

004:032 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a
        female without blemish.

004:033 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
        and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill
        the burnt offering.

004:034 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
        with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
        burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at
        the bottom of the altar:

004:035 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the
        lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
        and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to
        the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall
        make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it
        shall be forgiven him.

005:001 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a
        witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not
        utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.

005:002 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase
        of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the
        carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from
        him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.

005:003 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness
        it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from
        him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.

005:004 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or
        to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with
        an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then
        he shall be guilty in one of these.

005:005 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these
        things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that
        thing:

005:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his
        sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a
        kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall
        make an atonement for him concerning his sin.

005:007 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for
        his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two
        young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the
        other for a burnt offering.

005:008 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that
        which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head
        from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:

005:009 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon
        the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be
        wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.

005:010 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according
        to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him
        for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven
        him.

005:011 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young
        pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the
        tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he
        shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any
        frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.

005:012 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall
        take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it
        on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the
        LORD: it is a sin offering.

005:013 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his
        sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be
        forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat
        offering.

005:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

005:015 If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the
        holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass
        unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with
        thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the
        sanctuary, for a trespass offering.

005:016 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the
        holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it
        unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for
        him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be
        forgiven him.

005:017 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are
        forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though
        he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

005:018 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock,
        with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:
        and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his
        ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be
        forgiven him.

005:019 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed
        against the LORD.

006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:002 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie
        unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or
        in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath
        deceived his neighbour;

006:003 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it,
        and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth,
        sinning therein:

006:004 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that
        he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the
        thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was
        delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,

006:005 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even
        restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more
        thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the
        day of his trespass offering.

006:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram
        without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a
        trespass offering, unto the priest:

006:007 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the
        LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that
        he hath done in trespassing therein.

006:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:009 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the
        burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the
        burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the
        fire of the altar shall be burning in it.

006:010 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
        breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes
        which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the
        altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.

006:011 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments,
        and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.

006:012 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall
        not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every
        morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he
        shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.

006:013 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never
        go out.

006:014 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron
        shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.

006:015 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
        offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense
        which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the
        altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the
        LORD.

006:016 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
        unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the
        court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

006:017 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them
        for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most
        holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

006:018 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It
        shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the
        offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth
        them shall be holy.

006:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:020 This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they
        shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the
        tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering
        perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at
        night.

006:021 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou
        shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering
        shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

006:022 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall
        offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be
        wholly burnt.

006:023 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt:
        it shall not be eaten.

006:024 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:025 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of
        the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is
        killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is
        most holy.

006:026 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy
        place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

006:027 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and
        when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment,
        thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy
        place.

006:028 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken:
        and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured,
        and rinsed in water.

006:029 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most
        holy.

006:030 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into
        the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the
        holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

007:001 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most
        holy.

007:002 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they
        kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he
        sprinkle round about upon the altar.

007:003 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and
        the fat that covereth the inwards,

007:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by
        the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the
        kidneys, it shall he take away:

007:005 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering
        made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.

007:006 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be
        eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.

007:007 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is
        one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith
        shall have it.

007:008 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even
        the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt
        offering which he hath offered.

007:009 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all
        that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the
        priest's that offereth it.

007:010 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all
        the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

007:011 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
        he shall offer unto the LORD.

007:012 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with
        the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with
        oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes
        mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.

007:013 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened
        bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace
        offerings.

007:014 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an
        heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's
        that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.

007:015 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
        thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered;
        he shall not leave any of it until the morning.

007:016 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
        offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his
        sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be
        eaten:

007:017 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third
        day shall be burnt with fire.

007:018 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace
        offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be
        accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth
        it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it
        shall bear his iniquity.

007:019 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be
        eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all
        that be clean shall eat thereof.

007:020 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of
        peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his
        uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his
        people.

007:021 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
        uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable
        unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
        offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall
        be cut off from his people.

007:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

007:023 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no
        manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.

007:024 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of
        that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use:
        but ye shall in no wise eat of it.

007:025 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer
        an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that
        eateth it shall be cut off from his people.

007:026 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of
        fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.

007:027 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even
        that soul shall be cut off from his people.

007:028 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

007:029 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth
        the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring
        his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace
        offerings.

007:030 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by
        fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the
        breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.

007:031 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the
        breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

007:032 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an
        heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

007:033 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the
        peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder
        for his part.

007:034 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
        children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace
        offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto
        his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of
        Israel.

007:035 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
        anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made
        by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto
        the LORD in the priest's office;

007:036 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of
        Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for
        ever throughout their generations.

007:037 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering,
        and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of
        the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace
        offerings;

007:038 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that
        he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations
        unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.

008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

008:002 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the
        anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two
        rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;

008:003 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation.

008:004 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was
        gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

008:005 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which
        the LORD commanded to be done.

008:006 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with
        water.

008:007 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle,
        and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and
        he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound
        it unto him therewith.

008:008 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the
        breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.

008:009 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even
        upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy
        crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:010 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle
        and all that was therein, and sanctified them.

008:011 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and
        anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his
        foot, to sanctify them.

008:012 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and
        anointed him, to sanctify him.

008:013 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and
        girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the
        LORD commanded Moses.

008:014 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and
        his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the
        sin offering.

008:015 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the
        horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified
        the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar,
        and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.

008:016 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the
        caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and
        Moses burned it upon the altar.

008:017 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he
        burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:018 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and
        his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

008:019 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
        round about.

008:020 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and
        the pieces, and the fat.

008:021 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses
        burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice
        for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the
        LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:022 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and
        Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

008:023 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it
        upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his
        right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

008:024 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon
        the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right
        hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses
        sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.

008:025 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was
        upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two
        kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:

008:026 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the
        LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread,
        and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right
        shoulder:

008:027 And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands,
        and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.

008:028 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on
        the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for
        a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

008:029 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering
        before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses'
        part; as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:030 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which
        was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his
        garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with
        him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and
        his sons' garments with him.

008:031 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at
        the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat
        it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I
        commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

008:032 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall
        ye burn with fire.

008:033 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation in seven days, until the days of your
        consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate
        you.

008:034 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to
        make an atonement for you.

008:035 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of
        the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.

008:036 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded
        by the hand of Moses.

009:001 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron
        and his sons, and the elders of Israel;

009:002 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin
        offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and
        offer them before the LORD.

009:003 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take
        ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a
        lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt
        offering;

009:004 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice
        before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to
        day the LORD will appear unto you.

009:005 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the
        tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew
        near and stood before the LORD.

009:006 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded
        that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto
        you.

009:007 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy
        sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement
        for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the
        people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.

009:008 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the
        sin offering, which was for himself.

009:009 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he
        dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of
        the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the
        altar:

009:010 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of
        the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

009:011 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the
        camp.

009:012 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented
        unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the
        altar.

009:013 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the
        pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the
        altar.

009:014 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon
        the burnt offering on the altar.

009:015 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which
        was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered
        it for sin, as the first.

009:016 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to
        the manner.

009:017 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,
        and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the
        morning.

009:018 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
        offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons
        presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the
        altar round about,

009:019 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that
        which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul
        above the liver:

009:020 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat
        upon the altar:

009:021 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave
        offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.

009:022 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed
        them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the
        burnt offering, and peace offerings.

009:023 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the
        glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.

009:024 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed
        upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all
        the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

010:001 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them
        his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and
        offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them
        not.

010:002 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and
        they died before the LORD.

010:003 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,
        saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and
        before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his
        peace.

010:004 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the
        uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your
        brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

010:005 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the
        camp; as Moses had said.

010:006 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
        his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes;
        lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let
        your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning
        which the LORD hath kindled.

010:007 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD
        is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

010:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,

010:009 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with
        thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest
        ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your
        generations:

010:010 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and
        between unclean and clean;

010:011 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes
        which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.

010:012 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
        his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth
        of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without
        leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:

010:013 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due,
        and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire:
        for so I am commanded.

010:014 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
        place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for
        they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the
        sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.

010:015 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with
        the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave
        offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons'
        with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.

010:016 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
        behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and
        Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,

010:017 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy
        place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to
        bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for
        them before the LORD?

010:018 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy
        place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I
        commanded.

010:019 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered
        their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD;
        and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin
        offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of
        the LORD?

010:020 And when Moses heard that, he was content.

011:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

011:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the
        beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the
        earth.

011:003 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth
        the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

011:004 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud,
        or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he
        cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto
        you.

011:005 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not
        the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

011:006 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
        hoof; he is unclean unto you.

011:007 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,
        yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.

011:008 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye
        not touch; they are unclean to you.

011:009 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever
        hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the
        rivers, them shall ye eat.

011:010 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
        rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living
        thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination
        unto you:

011:011 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat
        of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in
        abomination.

011:012 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall
        be an abomination unto you.

011:013 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among
        the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination:
        the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

011:014 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

011:015 Every raven after his kind;

011:016 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk
        after his kind,

011:017 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

011:018 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

011:019 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and
        the bat.

011:020 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an
        abomination unto you.

011:021 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth
        upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap
        withal upon the earth;

011:022 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and
        the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind,
        and the grasshopper after his kind.

011:023 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,
        shall be an abomination unto you.

011:024 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the
        carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.

011:025 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash
        his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

011:026 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is
        not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you:
        every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.

011:027 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts
        that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso
        toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.

011:028 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his
        clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto
        you.

011:029 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things
        that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the
        tortoise after his kind,

011:030 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the
        snail, and the mole.

011:031 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth
        touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the
        even.

011:032 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth
        fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood,
        or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein
        any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be
        unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.

011:033 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,
        whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

011:034 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water
        cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in
        every such vessel shall be unclean.

011:035 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
        shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they
        shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be
        unclean unto you.

011:036 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of
        water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase
        shall be unclean.

011:037 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed
        which is to be sown, it shall be clean.

011:038 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their
        carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

011:039 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth
        the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

011:040 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his
        clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth
        the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until
        the even.

011:041 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be
        an abomination; it shall not be eaten.

011:042 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all
        four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things
        that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are
        an abomination.

011:043 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping
        thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean
        with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.

011:044 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify
        yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall
        ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that
        creepeth upon the earth.

011:045 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of
        Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am
        holy.

011:046 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every
        living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every
        creature that creepeth upon the earth:

011:047 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and
        between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not
        be eaten.

012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

012:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have
        conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be
        unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation
        for her infirmity shall she be unclean.

012:003 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
        circumcised.

012:004 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying
        three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor
        come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be
        fulfilled.

012:005 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two
        weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the
        blood of her purifying threescore and six days.

012:006 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son,
        or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year
        for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for
        a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, unto the priest:

012:007 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for
        her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood.
        This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.

012:008 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring
        two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt
        offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest
        shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.

013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,

013:002 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a
        scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like
        the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the
        priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:

013:003 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the
        flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and
        the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it
        is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and
        pronounce him unclean.

013:004 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in
        sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not
        turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the
        plague seven days:

013:005 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold,
        if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread
        not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days
        more:

013:006 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,
        behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread
        not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is
        but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

013:007 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he
        hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be
        seen of the priest again.

013:008 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the
        skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a
        leprosy.

013:009 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be
        brought unto the priest;

013:010 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be
        white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and
        there be quick raw flesh in the rising;

013:011 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest
        shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he
        is unclean.

013:012 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy
        cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head
        even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

013:013 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy
        have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that
        hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.

013:014 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

013:015 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to
        be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.

013:016 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he
        shall come unto the priest;

013:017 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be
        turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean
        that hath the plague: he is clean.

013:018 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a
        boil, and is healed,

013:019 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a
        bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to
        the priest;

013:020 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower
        than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the
        priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy
        broken out of the boil.

013:021 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
        hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be
        somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

013:022 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest
        shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.

013:023 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it
        is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

013:024 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot
        burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright
        spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

013:025 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair
        in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper
        than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning:
        wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the
        plague of leprosy.

013:026 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
        hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other
        skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up
        seven days:

013:027 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it
        be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
        pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

013:028 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in
        the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the
        burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is
        an inflammation of the burning.

013:029 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

013:030 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in
        sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin
        hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry
        scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.

013:031 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and,
        behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that
        there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up
        him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:

013:032 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague:
        and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no
        yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the
        skin;

013:033 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the
        priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:

013:034 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall:
        and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in
        sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce
        him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

013:035 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

013:036 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall
        be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow
        hair; he is unclean.

013:037 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is
        black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean:
        and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

013:038 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh
        bright spots, even white bright spots;

013:039 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots
        in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled
        spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.

013:040 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet
        is he clean.

013:041 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
        toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.

013:042 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white
        reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or
        his bald forehead.

013:043 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising
        of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald
        forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;

013:044 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce
        him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

013:045 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be
        rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his
        upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

013:046 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be
        defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp
        shall his habitation be.

013:047 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it
        be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;

013:048 Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen;
        whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

013:049 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in
        the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing
        of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto
        the priest:

013:050 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that
        hath the plague seven days:

013:051 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the
        plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
        woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the
        plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.

013:052 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in
        woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague
        is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the
        fire.

013:053 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not
        spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or
        in any thing of skin;

013:054 Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein
        the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:

013:055 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is
        washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his
        colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou
        shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be
        bare within or without.

013:056 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat
        dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the
        garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the
        woof:

013:057 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or
        in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading
        plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.

013:058 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of
        skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed
        from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall
        be clean.

013:059 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of
        woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of
        skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

014:002 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his
        cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:

014:003 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest
        shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in
        the leper;

014:004 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be
        cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and
        scarlet, and hyssop:

014:005 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed
        in an earthen vessel over running water:

014:006 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood,
        and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the
        living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the
        running water:

014:007 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the
        leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall
        let the living bird loose into the open field.

014:008 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and
        shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may
        be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and
        shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.

014:009 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all
        his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all
        his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes,
        also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

014:010 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without
        blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish,
        and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering,
        mingled with oil, and one log of oil.

014:011 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man
        that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD,
        at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:

014:012 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a
        trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a
        wave offering before the LORD:

014:013 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill
        the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place:
        for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass
        offering: it is most holy:

014:014 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
        offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the
        right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of
        his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

014:015 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it
        into the palm of his own left hand:

014:016 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is
        in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his
        finger seven times before the LORD:

014:017 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the
        priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
        cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
        great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass
        offering:

014:018 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he
        shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and
        the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.

014:019 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an
        atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness;
        and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:

014:020 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat
        offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an
        atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

014:021 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take
        one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an
        atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled
        with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;

014:022 And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able
        to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a
        burnt offering.

014:023 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing
        unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, before the LORD.

014:024 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering,
        and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave
        offering before the LORD:

014:025 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the
        priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering,
        and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
        cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
        great toe of his right foot:

014:026 And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own
        left hand:

014:027 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of
        the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD:

014:028 And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon
        the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and
        upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of
        his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass
        offering:

014:029 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall
        put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an
        atonement for him before the LORD.

014:030 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young
        pigeons, such as he can get;

014:031 Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering,
        and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering:
        and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be
        cleansed before the LORD.

014:032 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose
        hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his
        cleansing.

014:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

014:034 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you
        for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house
        of the land of your possession;

014:035 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest,
        saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the
        house:

014:036 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house,
        before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that
        is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest
        shall go in to see the house:

014:037 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be
        in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or
        reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;

014:038 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the
        house, and shut up the house seven days:

014:039 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall
        look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the
        house;

014:040 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones
        in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an
        unclean place without the city:

014:041 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about,
        and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without
        the city into an unclean place:

014:042 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of
        those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall
        plaister the house.

014:043 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house,
        after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath
        scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;

014:044 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the
        plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the
        house; it is unclean.

014:045 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the
        timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall
        carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.

014:046 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is
        shut up shall be unclean until the even.

014:047 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he
        that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

014:048 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and,
        behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the
        house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the
        house clean, because the plague is healed.

014:049 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar
        wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

014:050 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel
        over running water:

014:051 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the
        scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the
        slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house
        seven times:

014:052 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and
        with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the
        cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

014:053 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the
        open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall
        be clean.

014:054 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and
        scall,

014:055 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

014:056 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

014:057 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the
        law of leprosy.

015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,

015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any
        man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his
        issue he is unclean.

015:003 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his
        flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his
        issue, it is his uncleanness.

015:004 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean:
        and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

015:005 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and
        bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

015:006 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the
        issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
        be unclean until the even.

015:007 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue
        shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
        unclean until the even.

015:008 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean;
        then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
        and be unclean until the even.

015:009 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue
        shall be unclean.

015:010 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be
        unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those
        things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
        be unclean until the even.

015:011 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not
        rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and
        bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

015:012 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the
        issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be
        rinsed in water.

015:013 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then
        he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and
        wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and
        shall be clean.

015:014 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or
        two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the
        priest:

015:015 And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering,
        and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make
        an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.

015:016 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he
        shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the
        even.

015:017 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of
        copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until
        the even.

015:018 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of
        copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be
        unclean until the even.

015:019 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be
        blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever
        toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.

015:020 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be
        unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be
        unclean.

015:021 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and
        bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

015:022 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash
        his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until
        the even.

015:023 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth,
        when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.

015:024 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon
        him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon
        he lieth shall be unclean.

015:025 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the
        time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her
        separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall
        be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.

015:026 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be
        unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she
        sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her
        separation.

015:027 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and
        shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
        unclean until the even.

015:028 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to
        herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

015:029 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or
        two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door
        of the tabernacle of the congregation.

015:030 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
        other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an
        atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her
        uncleanness.

015:031 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
        uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they
        defile my tabernacle that is among them.

015:032 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose
        seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;

015:033 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath
        an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth
        with her that is unclean.

016:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons
        of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;

016:002 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother,
        that he come not at all times into the holy place within the
        vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die
        not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

016:003 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young
        bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

016:004 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the
        linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a
        linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired:
        these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in
        water, and so put them on.

016:005 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of
        Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram
        for a burnt offering.

016:006 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which
        is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his
        house.

016:007 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the
        LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

016:008 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the
        LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.

016:009 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell,
        and offer him for a sin offering.

016:010 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall
        be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with
        him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

016:011 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which
        is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and
        for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering
        which is for himself:

016:012 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from
        off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet
        incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:

016:013 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD,
        that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is
        upon the testimony, that he die not:

016:014 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it
        with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the
        mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger
        seven times.

016:015 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for
        the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with
        that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and
        sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:

016:016 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of
        the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of
        their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for
        the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them
        in the midst of their uncleanness.

016:017 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the
        congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy
        place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for
        himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation
        of Israel.

016:018 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD,
        and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of
        the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the
        horns of the altar round about.

016:019 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger
        seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the
        uncleanness of the children of Israel.

016:020 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place,
        and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he
        shall bring the live goat:

016:021 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live
        goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
        of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins,
        putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him
        away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:

016:022 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a
        land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the
        wilderness.

016:023 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,
        and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he
        went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:

016:024 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and
        put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt
        offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an
        atonement for himself, and for the people.

016:025 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.

016:026 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
        clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into
        the camp.

016:027 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
        offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the
        holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they
        shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their
        dung.

016:028 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his
        flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

016:029 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the
        seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict
        your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your
        own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:

016:030 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to
        cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before
        the LORD.

016:031 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict
        your souls, by a statute for ever.

016:032 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall
        consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's
        stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen
        clothes, even the holy garments:

016:033 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he
        shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an
        atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the
        congregation.

016:034 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
        atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a
        year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

017:002 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children
        of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD
        hath commanded, saying,

017:003 What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth
        an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out
        of the camp,

017:004 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the
        tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man;
        he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among
        his people:

017:005 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their
        sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they
        may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle
        of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace
        offerings unto the LORD.

017:006 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the
        LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and
        burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

017:007 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils,
        after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute
        for ever unto them throughout their generations.

017:008 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the
        house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you,
        that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,

017:009 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall
        be cut off from among his people.

017:010 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the
        strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of
        blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth
        blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

017:011 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it
        to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for
        it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.

017:012 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you
        shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth
        among you eat blood.

017:013 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of
        the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and
        catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even
        pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.

017:014 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the
        life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye
        shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all
        flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut
        off.

017:015 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that
        which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own
        country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and
        bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then
        shall he be clean.

017:016 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall
        bear his iniquity.

018:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

018:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the
        LORD your God.

018:003 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall
        ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither
        I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their
        ordinances.

018:004 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk
        therein: I am the LORD your God.

018:005 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which
        if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.

018:006 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him,
        to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.

018:007 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,
        shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not
        uncover her nakedness.

018:008 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it
        is thy father's nakedness.

018:009 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or
        daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born
        abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

018:010 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's
        daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for
        theirs is thine own nakedness.

018:011 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy
        father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her
        nakedness.

018:012 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister:
        she is thy father's near kinswoman.

018:013 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister:
        for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.

018:014 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother,
        thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.

018:015 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law:
        she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

018:016 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it
        is thy brother's nakedness.

018:017 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her
        daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her
        daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are
        her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.

018:018 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to
        uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.

018:019 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her
        nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.

018:020 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's
        wife, to defile thyself with her.

018:021 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire
        to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I
        am the LORD.

018:022 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
        abomination.

018:023 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself
        therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie
        down thereto: it is confusion.

018:024 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all
        these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:

018:025 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity
        thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her
        inhabitants.

018:026 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and
        shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of
        your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:

018:027 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done,
        which were before you, and the land is defiled;)

018:028 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it
        spued out the nations that were before you.

018:029 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the
        souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their
        people.

018:030 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any
        one of these abominable customs, which were committed before
        you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD
        your God.

019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

019:002 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and
        say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am
        holy.

019:003 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep
        my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.

019:004 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I
        am the LORD your God.

019:005 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD,
        ye shall offer it at your own will.

019:006 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow:
        and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in
        the fire.

019:007 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable;
        it shall not be accepted.

019:008 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,
        because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and
        that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

019:009 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not
        wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou
        gather the gleanings of thy harvest.

019:010 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou
        gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for
        the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.

019:011 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to
        another.

019:012 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
        profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

019:013 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the
        wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night
        until the morning.

019:014 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
        the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.

019:015 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not
        respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the
        mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

019:016 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy
        people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy
        neighbour; I am the LORD.

019:017 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in
        any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

019:018 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the
        children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as
        thyself: I am the LORD.

019:019 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle
        gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with
        mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and
        woollen come upon thee.

019:020 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,
        betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom
        given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to
        death, because she was not free.

019:021 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto
        the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for
        a trespass offering.

019:022 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
        the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he
        hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven
        him.

019:023 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted
        all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit
        thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as
        uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.

019:024 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to
        praise the LORD withal.

019:025 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that
        it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your
        God.

019:026 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye
        use enchantment, nor observe times.

019:027 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt
        thou mar the corners of thy beard.

019:028 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor
        print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.

019:029 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore;
        lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of
        wickedness.

019:030 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
        the LORD.

019:031 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
        wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.

019:032 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face
        of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.

019:033 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not
        vex him.

019:034 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as
        one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye
        were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

019:035 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in
        weight, or in measure.

019:036 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin,
        shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out
        of the land of Egypt.

019:037 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my
        judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.

020:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

020:002 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he
        be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn
        in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall
        surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him
        with stones.

020:003 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
        from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto
        Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

020:004 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
        the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him
        not:

020:005 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his
        family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after
        him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

020:006 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,
        and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set
        my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his
        people.

020:007 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the
        LORD your God.

020:008 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD
        which sanctify you.

020:009 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
        surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother;
        his blood shall be upon him.

020:010 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife,
        even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife,
        the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

020:011 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered
        his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to
        death; their blood shall be upon them.

020:012 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall
        surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their
        blood shall be upon them.

020:013 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
        of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be
        put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

020:014 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness:
        they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be
        no wickedness among you.

020:015 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to
        death: and ye shall slay the beast.

020:016 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,
        thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be
        put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

020:017 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or
        his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his
        nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in
        the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's
        nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.

020:018 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
        shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain,
        and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of
        them shall be cut off from among their people.

020:019 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's
        sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near
        kin: they shall bear their iniquity.

020:020 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath
        uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin;
        they shall die childless.

020:021 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean
        thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall
        be childless.

020:022 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
        and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell
        therein, spue you not out.

020:023 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I
        cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and
        therefore I abhorred them.

020:024 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I
        will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with
        milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated
        you from other people.

020:025 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
        unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not
        make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any
        manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I
        have separated from you as unclean.

020:026 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have
        severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.

020:027 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a
        wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them
        with stones: their blood shall be upon them.

021:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons
        of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for
        the dead among his people:

021:002 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his
        mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his
        daughter, and for his brother.

021:003 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath
        had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

021:004 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his
        people, to profane himself.

021:005 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall
        they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any
        cuttings in their flesh.

021:006 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of
        their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the
        bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be
        holy.

021:007 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane;
        neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for
        he is holy unto his God.

021:008 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread
        of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which
        sanctify you, am holy.

021:009 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by
        playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be
        burnt with fire.

021:010 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose
        head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to
        put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his
        clothes;

021:011 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself
        for his father, or for his mother;

021:012 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the
        sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of
        his God is upon him: I am the LORD.

021:013 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

021:014 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these
        shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own
        people to wife.

021:015 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the
        LORD do sanctify him.

021:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

021:017 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their
        generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to
        offer the bread of his God.

021:018 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not
        approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose,
        or any thing superfluous,

021:019 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,

021:020 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye,
        or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

021:021 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest
        shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by
        fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the
        bread of his God.

021:022 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and
        of the holy.

021:023 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the
        altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my
        sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

021:024 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all
        the children of Israel.

022:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

022:002 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate
        themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and
        that they profane not my holy name in those things which they
        hallow unto me: I am the LORD.

022:003 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your
        generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the
        children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his
        uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my
        presence: I am the LORD.

022:004 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a
        running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he
        be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the
        dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;

022:005 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be
        made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness,
        whatsoever uncleanness he hath;

022:006 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until
        even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his
        flesh with water.

022:007 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall
        afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.

022:008 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall
        not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.

022:009 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin
        for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do
        sanctify them.

022:010 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of
        the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy
        thing.

022:011 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of
        it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his
        meat.

022:012 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she
        may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

022:013 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have
        no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her
        youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be
        no stranger eat thereof.

022:014 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall
        put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the
        priest with the holy thing.

022:015 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
        Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

022:016 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat
        their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

022:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

022:018 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children
        of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of
        Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his
        oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings,
        which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;

022:019 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the
        beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

022:020 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it
        shall not be acceptable for you.

022:021 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the
        LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves
        or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be
        no blemish therein.

022:022 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or
        scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an
        offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.

022:023 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or
        lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill
        offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

022:024 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or
        crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering
        thereof in your land.

022:025 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of
        your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them,
        and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

022:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

022:027 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then
        it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day
        and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by
        fire unto the LORD.

022:028 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her
        young both in one day.

022:029 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the
        LORD, offer it at your own will.

022:030 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of
        it until the morrow: I am the LORD.

022:031 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the
        LORD.

022:032 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed
        among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,

022:033 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I
        am the LORD.

023:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,
        Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to
        be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.

023:003 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the
        sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work
        therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.

023:004 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations,
        which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.

023:005 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's
        passover.

023:006 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of
        unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat
        unleavened bread.

023:007 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall
        do no servile work therein.

023:008 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD
        seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye
        shall do no servile work therein.

023:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap
        the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the
        firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:

023:011 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted
        for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave
        it.

023:012 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb
        without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto
        the LORD.

023:013 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine
        flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD
        for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of
        wine, the fourth part of an hin.

023:014 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green
        ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering
        unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your
        generations in all your dwellings.

023:015 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,
        from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering;
        seven sabbaths shall be complete:

023:016 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number
        fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the
        LORD.

023:017 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two
        tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken
        with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.

023:018 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish
        of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they
        shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat
        offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by
        fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.

023:019 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin
        offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of
        peace offerings.

023:020 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the
        firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two
        lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.

023:021 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an
        holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work
        therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings
        throughout your generations.

023:022 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make
        clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest,
        neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou
        shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the
        LORD your God.

023:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:024 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh
        month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath,
        a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.

023:025 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an
        offering made by fire unto the LORD.

023:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:027 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a
        day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you;
        and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by
        fire unto the LORD.

023:028 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of
        atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your
        God.

023:029 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that
        same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

023:030 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same
        day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.

023:031 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
        throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

023:032 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict
        your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even
        unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

023:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:034 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day
        of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for
        seven days unto the LORD.

023:035 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no
        servile work therein.

023:036 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the
        LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you;
        and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it
        is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.

023:037 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to
        be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto
        the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice,
        and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:

023:038 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and
        beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings,
        which ye give unto the LORD.

023:039 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
        gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto
        the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and
        on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.

023:040 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly
        trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees,
        and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD
        your God seven days.

023:041 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the
        year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye
        shall celebrate it in the seventh month.

023:042 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites
        born shall dwell in booths:

023:043 That your generations may know that I made the children of
        Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land
        of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

023:044 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of
        the LORD.

024:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

024:002 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure
        oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn
        continually.

024:003 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
        congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the
        morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for
        ever in your generations.

024:004 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the
        LORD continually.

024:005 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:
        two tenth deals shall be in one cake.

024:006 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the
        pure table before the LORD.

024:007 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it
        may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by
        fire unto the LORD.

024:008 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD
        continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an
        everlasting covenant.

024:009 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it
        in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the
        offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.

024:010 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an
        Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son
        of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together
        in the camp;

024:011 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the
        Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his
        mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the
        tribe of Dan:)

024:012 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be
        shewed them.

024:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

024:014 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all
        that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the
        congregation stone him.

024:015 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
        Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.

024:016 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely
        be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly
        stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the
        land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put
        to death.

024:017 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.

024:018 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for
        beast.

024:019 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath
        done, so shall it be done to him;

024:020 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath
        caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.

024:021 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that
        killeth a man, he shall be put to death.

024:022 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as
        for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.

024:023 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should
        bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him
        with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep
        a sabbath unto the LORD.

025:003 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt
        prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

025:004 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the
        land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy
        field, nor prune thy vineyard.

025:005 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
        not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for
        it is a year of rest unto the land.

025:006 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee,
        and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired
        servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.

025:007 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land,
        shall all the increase thereof be meat.

025:008 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
        times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of
        years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.

025:009 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on
        the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement
        shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

025:010 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
        throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it
        shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto
        his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.

025:011 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not
        sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor
        gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.

025:012 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat
        the increase thereof out of the field.

025:013 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
        possession.

025:014 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
        thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:

025:015 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt
        buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years
        of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:

025:016 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the
        price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou
        shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of
        the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.

025:017 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt
        fear thy God:for I am the LORD your God.

025:018 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and
        do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

025:019 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your
        fill, and dwell therein in safety.

025:020 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year?
        behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

025:021 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year,
        and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

025:022 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit
        until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of
        the old store.

025:023 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for
        ye are strangers and sojourners with me.

025:024 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
        redemption for the land.

025:025 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
        possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then
        shall he redeem that which his brother sold.

025:026 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to
        redeem it;

025:027 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore
        the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may
        return unto his possession.

025:028 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is
        sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until
        the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he
        shall return unto his possession.

025:029 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he
        may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a
        full year may he redeem it.

025:030 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year,
        then the house that is in the walled city shall be established
        for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it
        shall not go out in the jubile.

025:031 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
        them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may
        be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.

025:032 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of
        the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any
        time.

025:033 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was
        sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year
        of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are
        their possession among the children of Israel.

025:034 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
        for it is their perpetual possession.

025:035 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with
        thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a
        stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.

025:036 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that
        thy brother may live with thee.

025:037 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
        victuals for increase.

025:038 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
        land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your
        God.

025:039 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be
        sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a
        bondservant:

025:040 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
        thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.

025:041 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
        with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the
        possession of his fathers shall he return.

025:042 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the
        land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.

025:043 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
        God.

025:044 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
        shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them
        shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.

025:045 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn
        among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that
        are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be
        your possession.

025:046 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children
        after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be
        your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of
        Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.

025:047 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy
        brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto
        the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the
        stranger's family:

025:048 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his
        brethren may redeem him:

025:049 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any
        that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or
        if he be able, he may redeem himself.

025:050 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year
        that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price
        of his sale shall be according unto the number of years,
        according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with
        him.

025:051 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he
        shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money
        that he was bought for.

025:052 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile,
        then he shall count with him, and according unto his years
        shall he give him again the price of his redemption.

025:053 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the
        other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

025:054 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
        in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.

025:055 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
        servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am
        the LORD your God.

026:001 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you
        up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of
        stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD
        your God.

026:002 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
        the LORD.

026:003 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do
        them;

026:004 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall
        yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield
        their fruit.

026:005 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the
        vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat
        your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

026:006 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and
        none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of
        the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.

026:007 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before
        you by the sword.

026:008 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you
        shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall
        before you by the sword.

026:009 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and
        multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.

026:010 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of
        the new.

026:011 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor
        you.

026:012 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall
        be my people.

026:013 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
        land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have
        broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.

026:014 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
        commandments;

026:015 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my
        judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but
        that ye break my covenant:

026:016 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you
        terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume
        the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your
        seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

026:017 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain
        before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you;
        and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.

026:018 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I
        will punish you seven times more for your sins.

026:019 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
        heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:

026:020 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall
        not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land
        yield their fruits.

026:021 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me;
        I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to
        your sins.

026:022 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of
        your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in
        number; and your high ways shall be desolate.

026:023 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will
        walk contrary unto me;

026:024 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you
        yet seven times for your sins.

026:025 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the
        quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together
        within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and
        ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

026:026 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women
        shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you
        your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be
        satisfied.

026:027 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk
        contrary unto me;

026:028 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even
        I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

026:029 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
        daughters shall ye eat.

026:030 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,
        and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my
        soul shall abhor you.

026:031 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
        unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet
        odours.

026:032 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies
        which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

026:033 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
        sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your
        cities waste.

026:034 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
        desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the
        land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.

026:035 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not
        rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

026:036 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a
        faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and
        the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall
        flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none
        pursueth.

026:037 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a
        sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand
        before your enemies.

026:038 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your
        enemies shall eat you up.

026:039 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their
        iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of
        their fathers shall they pine away with them.

026:040 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of
        their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed
        against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;

026:041 And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have
        brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their
        uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the
        punishment of their iniquity:

026:042 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my
        covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I
        remember; and I will remember the land.

026:043 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
        sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they
        shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because,
        even because they despised my judgments, and because their
        soul abhorred my statutes.

026:044 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their
        enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them,
        to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them:
        for I am the LORD their God.

026:045 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
        ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in
        the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the
        LORD.

026:046 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
        made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by
        the hand of Moses.

027:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

027:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a
        man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the
        LORD by thy estimation.

027:003 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old
        even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty
        shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

027:004 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty
        shekels.

027:005 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old,
        then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and
        for the female ten shekels.

027:006 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then
        thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver,
        and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of
        silver.

027:007 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,
        then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the
        female ten shekels.

027:008 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
        himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him;
        according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value
        him.

027:009 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the
        LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be
        holy.

027:010 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a
        bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast,
        then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.

027:011 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
        sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast
        before the priest:

027:012 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as
        thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.

027:013 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth
        part thereof unto thy estimation.

027:014 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
        LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or
        bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

027:015 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he
        shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto
        it, and it shall be his.

027:016 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field
        of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to
        the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at
        fifty shekels of silver.

027:017 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to
        thy estimation it shall stand.

027:018 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest
        shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that
        remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be
        abated from thy estimation.

027:019 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem
        it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy
        estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.

027:020 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the
        field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

027:021 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy
        unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof
        shall be the priest's.

027:022 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath
        bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;

027:023 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy
        estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall
        give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the
        LORD.

027:024 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of
        whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the
        land did belong.

027:025 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of
        the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

027:026 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's
        firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or
        sheep: it is the LORD's.

027:027 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it
        according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of
        it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold
        according to thy estimation.

027:028 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto
        the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of
        the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every
        devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.

027:029 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be
        redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.

027:030 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the
        land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy
        unto the LORD.

027:031 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall
        add thereto the fifth part thereof.

027:032 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
        whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto
        the LORD.

027:033 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall
        he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the
        change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

027:034 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for
        the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

Book 04	Numbers

001:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
        the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the
        second month, in the second year after they were come out of
        the land of Egypt, saying,

001:002 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of
        Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers,
        with the number of their names, every male by their polls;

001:003 From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go
        forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by
        their armies.

001:004 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one
        head of the house of his fathers.

001:005 And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you:

001:016 These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the
        tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.

001:017 And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by
        their names:

001:018 And they assembled all the congregation together on the first
        day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees
        after their families, by the house of their fathers, according
        to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
        by their polls.

001:019 As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the
        wilderness of Sinai.

001:020 And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their
        generations, after their families, by the house of their
        fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls,
        every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were

        were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.

001:031 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Zebulun, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.

001:032 Of the children of Joseph, namely, of the children of Ephraim,
        by their generations, after their families, by the house of
        their fathers, according to the number of the names, from
        twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to
        war;

001:033 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred.

001:034 Of the children of Manasseh, by their generations, after their

001:037 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Benjamin, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

001:038 Of the children of Dan, by their generations, after their
        families, by the house of their fathers, according to the
        number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all

001:039 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Dan,
        were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

001:040 Of the children of Asher, by their generations, after their

        all that were able to go forth to war;

001:043 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.

001:044 These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron
        numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each
        one was for the house of his fathers.

001:045 So were all those that were numbered of the children of
        Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old
        and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;

001:046 Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and
        three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

001:047 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not
        numbered among them.

001:048 For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,

001:049 Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the
        sum of them among the children of Israel:

001:050 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of
        testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all
        things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and
        all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and
        shall encamp round about the tabernacle.

001:051 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall
        take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the
        Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh
        shall be put to death.

001:052 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man
        by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout
        their hosts.

001:053 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of
        testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the
        children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of
        the tabernacle of testimony.

001:054 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
        commanded Moses, so did they.

002:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

002:002 Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own
        standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off
        about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.

002:003 And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they
        of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their
        armies: and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of
        the children of Judah.

002:004 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
        threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

002:005 And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of
        Issachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of
        the children of Issachar.

002:006 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty
        and four thousand and four hundred.

002:007 Then the tribe of Zebulun: and Eliab the son of Helon shall be
        captain of the children of Zebulun.

002:008 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty
        and seven thousand and four hundred.

002:009 All that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred
        thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four
        hundred, throughout their armies. These shall first set forth.

002:010 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben
        according to their armies: and the captain of the children of
        Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.

002:011 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty
        and six thousand and five hundred.

002:012 And those which pitch by him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and
        the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the
        son of Zurishaddai.

002:013 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
        and nine thousand and three hundred.

002:014 Then the tribe of Gad: and the captain of the sons of Gad
        shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.

002:015 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
        and five thousand and six hundred and fifty.

002:016 All that were numbered in the camp of Reuben were an hundred
        thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and
        fifty, throughout their armies. And they shall set forth in
        the second rank.

002:017 Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with
        the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp: as they
        encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by
        their standards.

002:018 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim
        according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of
        Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.

002:019 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
        thousand and five hundred.

002:020 And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh: and the captain of
        the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of
        Pedahzur.

002:021 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
        thirty and two thousand and two hundred.

002:022 Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the captain of the sons of
        Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.

002:023 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
        thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

002:024 All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were an hundred
        thousand and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their
        armies. And they shall go forward in the third rank.

002:025 The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by
        their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan shall be
        Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

002:026 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
        threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

002:027 And those that encamp by him shall be the tribe of Asher: and
        the captain of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son
        of Ocran.

002:028 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
        and one thousand and five hundred.

002:029 Then the tribe of Naphtali: and the captain of the children of
        Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.

002:030 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
        and three thousand and four hundred.

002:031 All they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred
        thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They
        shall go hindmost with their standards.

002:032 These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel
        by the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of
        the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and
        three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

002:033 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of
        Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

002:034 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
        commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so
        they set forward, every one after their families, according to
        the house of their fathers.

003:001 These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day
        that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.

003:002 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the
        firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

003:003 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which
        were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's
        office.

003:004 And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered
        strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and
        they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in
        the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.

003:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

003:006 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron
        the priest, that they may minister unto him.

003:007 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
        congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do
        the service of the tabernacle.

003:008 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of
        the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to
        do the service of the tabernacle.

003:009 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons:
        they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.

003:010 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait
        on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh
        shall be put to death.

003:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

003:012 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the
        children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth
        the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites
        shall be mine;

003:013 Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I
        smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto
        me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall
        they be: I am the LORD.

003:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,
        saying,

003:015 Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers,
        by their families: every male from a month old and upward
        shalt thou number them.

003:016 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as
        he was commanded.

003:017 And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and
        Kohath, and Merari.

003:018 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their
        families; Libni, and Shimei.

003:019 And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar,
        Hebron, and Uzziel.

003:020 And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi.
        These are the families of the Levites according to the house
        of their fathers.

003:021 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of
        the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites.

003:022 Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of
        all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that
        were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.

003:023 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the
        tabernacle westward.

003:024 And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites
        shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.

003:025 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the
        congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the
        covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation,

003:026 And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of
        the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round
        about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.

003:027 And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family
        of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the
        family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the
        Kohathites.

003:028 In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward,
        were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the
        sanctuary.

003:029 The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of
        the tabernacle southward.

003:030 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
        the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

003:031 And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the
        candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary
        wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service
        thereof.

003:032 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over
        the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that
        keep the charge of the sanctuary.

003:033 Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of
        the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.

003:034 And those that were numbered of them, according to the number
        of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six
        thousand and two hundred.

003:035 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
        Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the
        side of the tabernacle northward.

003:036 And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall
        be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the
        pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels
        thereof, and all that serveth thereto,

003:037 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
        and their pins, and their cords.

003:038 But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east,
        even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall
        be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the
        sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the
        stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

003:039 All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron
        numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their
        families, all the males from a month old and upward, were
        twenty and two thousand.

003:040 And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the
        males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward,
        and take the number of their names.

003:041 And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead
        of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the
        cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the
        cattle of the children of Israel.

003:042 And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the
        firstborn among the children of Israel.

003:043 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a
        month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them,
        were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and
        thirteen.

003:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

003:045 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the
        children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of
        their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD.

003:046 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and
        threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of
        Israel, which are more than the Levites;

003:047 Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after
        the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel
        is twenty gerahs:)

003:048 And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of
        them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.

003:049 And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and
        above them that were redeemed by the Levites:

003:050 Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money;
        a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels,
        after the shekel of the sanctuary:

003:051 And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron
        and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the
        LORD commanded Moses.

004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

004:002 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of
        Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers,

004:003 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old,
        all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle
        of the congregation.

004:004 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the
        tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things:

004:005 And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his
        sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover
        the ark of testimony with it:

004:006 And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and
        shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in
        the staves thereof.

004:007 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of
        blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the
        bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread
        shall be thereon:

004:008 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover
        the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in
        the staves thereof.

004:009 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick
        of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his
        snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they
        minister unto it:

004:010 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a
        covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.

004:011 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue,
        and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put
        to the staves thereof:

004:012 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith
        they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of
        blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and
        shall put them on a bar:

004:013 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread
        a purple cloth thereon:

004:014 And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith
        they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and
        the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and
        they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and
        put to the staves of it.

004:015 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
        sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp
        is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come
        to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they
        die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the
        tabernacle of the congregation.

004:016 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
        pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and
        the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the
        oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is,
        in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.

004:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying,

004:018 Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites
        from among the Levites:

004:019 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when
        they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons
        shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to
        his burden:

004:020 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are
        covered, lest they die.

004:021 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

004:022 Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the
        houses of their fathers, by their families;

004:023 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt
        thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to
        do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:024 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to
        serve, and for burdens:

004:025 And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the
        tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering
        of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging
        for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,

004:026 And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of
        the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the
        altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of
        their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they
        serve.

004:027 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the
        service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens,
        and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in
        charge all their burdens.

004:028 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in
        the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be
        under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

004:029 As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their
        families, by the house of their fathers;

004:030 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old
        shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the
        service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:031 And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their
        service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of
        the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof,
        and sockets thereof,

004:032 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
        and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments,
        and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the
        instruments of the charge of their burden.

004:033 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
        according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the
        congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the
        priest.

004:034 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered
        the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the
        house of their fathers,

004:035 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
        every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
        tabernacle of the congregation:

004:036 And those that were numbered of them by their families were
        two thousand seven hundred and fifty.

004:037 These were they that were numbered of the families of the
        Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
        congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to
        the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

004:038 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon,
        throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers,

004:039 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
        every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
        tabernacle of the congregation,

004:040 Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their
        families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and
        six hundred and thirty.

004:041 These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons
        of Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of
        the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to
        the commandment of the LORD.

004:042 And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
        Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their
        fathers,

004:043 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
        every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
        tabernacle of the congregation,

004:044 Even those that were numbered of them after their families,
        were three thousand and two hundred.

004:045 These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons
        of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word
        of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

004:046 All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and
        Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families,
        and after the house of their fathers,

004:047 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
        every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the
        service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:048 Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and
        five hundred and fourscore,

004:049 According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by
        the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and
        according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as
        the LORD commanded Moses.

005:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

005:002 Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp
        every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever
        is defiled by the dead:

005:003 Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall
        ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst
        whereof I dwell.

005:004 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without
        the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of
        Israel.

005:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

005:006 Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall
        commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the
        LORD, and that person be guilty;

005:007 Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he
        shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and
        add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him
        against whom he hath trespassed.

005:008 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass
        unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to
        the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an
        atonement shall be made for him.

005:009 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of
        Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

005:010 And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any
        man giveth the priest, it shall be his.

005:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

005:012 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
        man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,

005:013 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes
        of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and
        there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the
        manner;

005:014 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of
        his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy
        come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not
        defiled:

005:015 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he
        shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah
        of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put
        frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an
        offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

005:016 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the
        LORD:

005:017 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and
        of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest
        shall take, and put it into the water:

005:018 And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and
        uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in
        her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest
        shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the
        curse:

005:019 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the
        woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not
        gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband,
        be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:

005:020 But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband,
        and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee
        beside thine husband:

005:021 Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of
        cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD
        make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD
        doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;

005:022 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy
        bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And
        the woman shall say, Amen, amen.

005:023 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he
        shall blot them out with the bitter water:

005:024 And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that
        causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall
        enter into her, and become bitter.

005:025 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the
        woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and
        offer it upon the altar:

005:026 And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the
        memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward
        shall cause the woman to drink the water.

005:027 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall
        come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass
        against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse
        shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall
        swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse
        among her people.

005:028 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall
        be free, and shall conceive seed.

005:029 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to
        another instead of her husband, and is defiled;

005:030 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be
        jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the
        LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.

005:031 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman
        shall bear her iniquity.

006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When
        either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of
        a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the LORD:

006:003 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and
        shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink,
        neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist
        grapes, or dried.

006:004 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is
        made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

006:005 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor
        come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which
        he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and
        shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.

006:006 All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall
        come at no dead body.

006:007 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his
        mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die:
        because the consecration of his God is upon his head.

006:008 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.

006:009 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled
        the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in
        the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave
        it.

006:010 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
        pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation:

006:011 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
        other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for
        that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that
        same day.

006:012 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his
        separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a
        trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be
        lost, because his separation was defiled.

006:013 And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his
        separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation:

006:014 And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of
        the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one
        ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering,
        and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,

006:015 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled
        with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil,
        and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.

006:016 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall
        offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:

006:017 And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings
        unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest
        shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.

006:018 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the
        door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the
        hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire
        which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

006:019 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and
        one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened
        wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite,
        after the hair of his separation is shaven:

006:020 And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the
        LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and
        heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.

006:021 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his
        offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that
        his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he
        must do after the law of his separation.

006:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:023 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye
        shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,

006:024 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:

006:025 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
        thee:

006:026 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee
        peace.

006:027 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I
        will bless them.

007:001 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
        tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all
        the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels
        thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;

007:002 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their
        fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over
        them that were numbered, offered:

007:003 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered
        wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and
        for each one an ox: and they brought them before the
        tabernacle.

007:004 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

007:005 Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the
        tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto
        the Levites, to every man according to his service.

007:006 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
        Levites.

007:007 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon,
        according to their service:

007:008 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of
        Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of
        Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

007:009 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service
        of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear
        upon their shoulders.

007:010 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day
        that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering
        before the altar.

007:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering,
        each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

007:012 And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the
        son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah:

007:013 And his offering was one silver charger, the weight thereof
        was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy
        shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them were

007:089 And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the
        congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one
        speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the
        ark of testimony, from between the two cherubims: and he spake
        unto him.

008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

008:002 Speak unto Aaron and say unto him, When thou lightest the
        lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the
        candlestick.

008:003 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against
        the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:004 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the
        shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work:
        according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so
        he made the candlestick.

008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

008:006 Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and
        cleanse them.

008:007 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle
        water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their
        flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves
        clean.

008:008 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering,
        even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock
        shalt thou take for a sin offering.

008:009 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
        congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the
        children of Israel together:

008:010 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the
        children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:

008:011 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an
        offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the
        service of the LORD.

008:012 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
        bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and
        the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an
        atonement for the Levites.

008:013 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his
        sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD.

008:014 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children
        of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.

008:015 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of
        the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse
        them, and offer them for an offering.

008:016 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of
        Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of
        the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them
        unto me.

008:017 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both
        man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the
        land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

008:018 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the
        children of Israel.

008:019 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his
        sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of
        the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation,
        and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that
        there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the
        children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

008:020 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children
        of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD
        commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of
        Israel unto them.

008:021 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes;
        and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and
        Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.

008:022 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the
        tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his
        sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites,
        so did they unto them.

008:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

008:024 This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and
        five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the
        service of the tabernacle of the congregation:

008:025 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon
        the service thereof, and shall serve no more:

008:026 But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of
        the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service.
        Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.

009:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
        the first month of the second year after they were come out of
        the land of Egypt, saying,

009:002 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his
        appointed season.

009:003 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it
        in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and
        according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

009:004 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should
        keep the passover.

009:005 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
        month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all
        that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.

009:006 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body
        of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day:
        and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:

009:007 And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body
        of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an
        offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the
        children of Israel?

009:008 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what
        the LORD will command concerning you.

009:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

009:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you
        or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead
        body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the
        passover unto the LORD.

009:011 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
        it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

009:012 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any
        bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover
        they shall keep it.

009:013 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and
        forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be
        cut off from among his people: because he brought not the
        offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall
        bear his sin.

009:014 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
        passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the
        passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do:
        ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for
        him that was born in the land.

009:015 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
        covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and
        at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the
        appearance of fire, until the morning.

009:016 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the
        appearance of fire by night.

009:017 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then
        after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place
        where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched
        their tents.

009:018 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel
        journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as
        long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in
        their tents.

009:019 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,
        then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and
        journeyed not.

009:020 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the
        tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they
        abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the
        LORD they journeyed.

009:021 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the
        morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then
        they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the
        cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

009:022 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the
        cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the
        children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not:
        but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

009:023 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and
        at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the
        charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand
        of Moses.

010:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

010:002 Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou
        make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the
        assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.

010:003 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall
        assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of
        the congregation.

010:004 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which
        are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves
        unto thee.

010:005 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east
        parts shall go forward.

010:006 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie
        on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an
        alarm for their journeys.

010:007 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall
        blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.

010:008 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the
        trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever
        throughout your generations.

010:009 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that
        oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets;
        and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye
        shall be saved from your enemies.

010:010 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and
        in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the
        trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of
        your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial
        before your God: I am the LORD your God.

010:011 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month,
        in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the
        tabernacle of the testimony.

010:012 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
        wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of
        Paran.

010:013 And they first took their journey according to the commandment
        of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

010:014 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the
        children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host
        was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

010:015 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
        Nethaneel the son of Zuar.

010:016 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was
        Eliab the son of Helon.

010:017 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and
        the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.

010:018 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according
        to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of
        Shedeur.

010:019 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
        Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

010:020 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was
        Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

010:021 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the
        other did set up the tabernacle against they came.

010:022 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set
        forward according to their armies: and over his host was
        Elishama the son of Ammihud.

010:023 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was
        Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

010:024 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
        Abidan the son of Gideoni.

010:025 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set
        forward, which was the rereward of all the camps throughout
        their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of
        Ammishaddai.

010:026 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was
        Pagiel the son of Ocran.

010:027 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was
        Ahira the son of Enan.

010:028 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according
        to their armies, when they set forward.

010:029 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,
        Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of
        which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us,
        and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good
        concerning Israel.

010:030 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine
        own land, and to my kindred.

010:031 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou
        knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou
        mayest be to us instead of eyes.

010:032 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that
        what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do
        unto thee.

010:033 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days'
        journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before
        them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place
        for them.

010:034 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went
        out of the camp.

010:035 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses
        said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and
        let them that hate thee flee before thee.

010:036 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many
        thousands of Israel.

011:001 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and
        the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of
        the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the
        uttermost parts of the camp.

011:002 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto
        the LORD, the fire was quenched.

011:003 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire
        of the LORD burnt among them.

011:004 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and
        the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall
        give us flesh to eat?

011:005 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the
        cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and
        the garlick:

011:006 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all,
        beside this manna, before our eyes.

011:007 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
        the colour of bdellium.

011:008 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
        mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made
        cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh
        oil.

011:009 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna
        fell upon it.

011:010 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
        every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD
        was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.

011:011 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted
        thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy
        sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?

011:012 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that
        thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a
        nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which
        thou swarest unto their fathers?

011:013 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for
        they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

011:014 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
        heavy for me.

011:015 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
        hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see
        my wretchedness.

011:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of
        the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of
        the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the
        tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with
        thee.

011:017 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take
        of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them;
        and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that
        thou bear it not thyself alone.

011:018 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
        morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears
        of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it
        was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you
        flesh, and ye shall eat.

011:019 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
        ten days, nor twenty days;

011:020 But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils,
        and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised
        the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying,
        Why came we forth out of Egypt?

011:021 And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred
        thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh,
        that they may eat a whole month.

011:022 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
        them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together
        for them, to suffice them?

011:023 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short?
        thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto
        thee or not.

011:024 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
        and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and
        set them round about the tabernacle.

011:025 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and
        took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the
        seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit
        rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.

011:026 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
        one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit
        rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but
        went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the
        camp.

011:027 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
        Medad do prophesy in the camp.

011:028 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his
        young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

011:029 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
        that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD
        would put his spirit upon them!

011:030 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

011:031 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
        from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a
        day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on
        the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two
        cubits high upon the face of the earth.

011:032 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
        all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that
        gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all
        abroad for themselves round about the camp.

011:033 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
        chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people,
        and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

011:034 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because
        there they buried the people that lusted.

011:035 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
        and abode at Hazeroth.

012:001 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the
        Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an
        Ethiopian woman.

012:002 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath
        he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.

012:003 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were
        upon the face of the earth.)

012:004 And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and
        unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the
        congregation. And they three came out.

012:005 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood
        in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam:
        and they both came forth.

012:006 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among
        you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision,
        and will speak unto him in a dream.

012:007 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.

012:008 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not
        in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he
        behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my
        servant Moses?

012:009 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he
        departed.

012:010 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,
        Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon
        Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.

012:011 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay
        not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and
        wherein we have sinned.

012:012 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed
        when he cometh out of his mother's womb.

012:013 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
        beseech thee.

012:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in
        her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be
        shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be
        received in again.

012:015 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the
        people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

012:016 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in
        the wilderness of Paran.

013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

013:002 Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which
        I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their
        fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.

013:003 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the
        wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children
        of Israel.

013:004 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua
        the son of Zaccur.

013:005 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

013:006 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

013:007 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

013:008 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

013:009 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

013:010 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

013:011 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh,
        Gaddi the son of Susi.

013:012 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

013:013 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

013:014 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

013:015 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

013:016 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
        land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.

013:017 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said
        unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the
        mountain:

013:018 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth
        therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;

013:019 And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or
        bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in
        tents, or in strong holds;

013:020 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there
        be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring
        of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the
        firstripe grapes.

013:021 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of
        Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

013:022 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
        Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now
        Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

013:023 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from
        thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it
        between two upon a staff; and they brought of the
        pomegranates, and of the figs.

013:024 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster
        of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.

013:025 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

013:026 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
        congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of
        Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto
        all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.

013:027 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither
        thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey;
        and this is the fruit of it.

013:028 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and
        the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the
        children of Anak there.

013:029 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the
        Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the
        mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the
        coast of Jordan.

013:030 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go
        up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome
        it.

013:031 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go
        up against the people; for they are stronger than we.

013:032 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
        searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land,
        through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth
        up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in
        it are men of a great stature.

013:033 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of
        the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and
        so we were in their sight.

014:001 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and
        the people wept that night.

014:002 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and
        against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them,
        Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God
        we had died in this wilderness!

014:003 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall
        by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a
        prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?

014:004 And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let
        us return into Egypt.

014:005 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the
        assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.

014:006 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
        which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:

014:007 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel,
        saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an
        exceeding good land.

014:008 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this
        land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and
        honey.

014:009 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people
        of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is
        departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.

014:010 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the
        glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the
        congregation before all the children of Israel.

014:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people
        provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for
        all the signs which I have shewed among them?

014:012 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them,
        and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

014:013 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear
        it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from
        among them;)

014:014 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for
        they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that
        thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth
        over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a
        pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.

014:015 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the
        nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,

014:016 Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the
        land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in
        the wilderness.

014:017 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great,
        according as thou hast spoken, saying,

014:018 The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving
        iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the
        guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
        unto the third and fourth generation.

014:019 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according
        unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven
        this people, from Egypt even until now.

014:020 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:

014:021 But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the
        glory of the LORD.

014:022 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my
        miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have
        tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my
        voice;

014:023 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their
        fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:

014:024 But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him,
        and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land
        whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.

014:025 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
        Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way
        of the Red sea.

014:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

014:027 How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which
        murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children
        of Israel, which they murmur against me.

014:028 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have
        spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:

014:029 Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were
        numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty
        years old and upward which have murmured against me.

014:030 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I
        sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of
        Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

014:031 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them
        will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have
        despised.

014:032 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this
        wilderness.

014:033 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,
        and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the
        wilderness.

014:034 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land,
        even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your
        iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of
        promise.

014:035 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
        congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this
        wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

014:036 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who
        returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him,
        by bringing up a slander upon the land,

014:037 Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the
        land, died by the plague before the LORD.

014:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
        which were of the men that went to search the land, lived
        still.

014:039 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:
        and the people mourned greatly.

014:040 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into
        the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go
        up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have
        sinned.

014:041 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
        of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.

014:042 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not
        smitten before your enemies.

014:043 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you,
        and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away
        from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.

014:044 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the
        ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out
        of the camp.

014:045 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt
        in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto
        Hormah.

015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto
        you,

015:003 And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt
        offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill
        offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour
        unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:

015:004 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a
        meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth
        part of an hin of oil.

015:005 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering
        shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for
        one lamb.

015:006 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
        deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.

015:007 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an
        hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

015:008 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for
        a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the
        LORD:

015:009 Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three
        tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

015:010 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,
        for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

015:011 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for
        a lamb, or a kid.

015:012 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do
        to every one according to their number.

015:013 All that are born of the country shall do these things after
        this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet
        savour unto the LORD.

015:014 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you
        in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire,
        of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.

015:015 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and
        also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance
        for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger
        be before the LORD.

015:016 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger
        that sojourneth with you.

015:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

015:018 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        come into the land whither I bring you,

015:019 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land,
        ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.

015:020 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an
        heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the
        threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.

015:021 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an
        heave offering in your generations.

015:022 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,
        which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,

015:023 Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of
        Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and
        henceforward among your generations;

015:024 Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without
        the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation
        shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a
        sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his
        drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the
        goats for a sin offering.

015:025 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the
        congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be
        forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their
        offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their
        sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:

015:026 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children
        of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing
        all the people were in ignorance.

015:027 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a
        she goat of the first year for a sin offering.

015:028 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that
        sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the
        LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven
        him.

015:029 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,
        both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and
        for the stranger that sojourneth among them.

015:030 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be
        born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the
        LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

015:031 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken
        his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his
        iniquity shall be upon him.

015:032 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they
        found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.

015:033 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto
        Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

015:034 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what
        should be done to him.

015:035 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to
        death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones
        without the camp.

015:036 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and
        stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

015:037 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

015:038 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make
        them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their
        generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders
        a ribband of blue:

015:039 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon
        it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do
        them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own
        eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:

015:040 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy
        unto your God.

015:041 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
        Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.

016:001 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of
        Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the
        son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:

016:002 And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of
        Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous
        in the congregation, men of renown:

016:003 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and
        against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you,
        seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and
        the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
        above the congregation of the LORD?

016:004 And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:

016:005 And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even
        to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and
        will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath
        chosen will he cause to come near unto him.

016:006 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;

016:007 And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD
        to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth
        choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons
        of Levi.

016:008 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:

016:009 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel
        hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring
        you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the
        LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto
        them?

016:010 And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the
        sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?

016:011 For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered
        together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur
        against him?

016:012 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab:
        which said, We will not come up:

016:013 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land
        that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the
        wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over
        us?

016:014 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth
        with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and
        vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will
        not come up.

016:015 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not
        thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them,
        neither have I hurt one of them.

016:016 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before
        the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:

016:017 And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and
        bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and
        fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.

016:018 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and
        laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle
        of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.

016:019 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the
        door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of
        the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.

016:020 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

016:021 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
        consume them in a moment.

016:022 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of
        the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be
        wroth with all the congregation?

016:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

016:024 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
        tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

016:025 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
        elders of Israel followed him.

016:026 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray
        you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of
        their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.

016:027 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and
        Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and
        stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their
        sons, and their little children.

016:028 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent
        me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own
        mind.

016:029 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be
        visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath
        not sent me.

016:030 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her
        mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them,
        and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand
        that these men have provoked the LORD.

016:031 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all
        these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under
        them:

016:032 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and
        their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and
        all their goods.

016:033 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into
        the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished
        from among the congregation.

016:034 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of
        them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.

016:035 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two
        hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

016:036 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

016:037 Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take
        up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire
        yonder; for they are hallowed.

016:038 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them
        make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they
        offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and
        they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.

016:039 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they
        that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates
        for a covering of the altar:

016:040 To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no
        stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to
        offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as
        his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.

016:041 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of
        Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye
        have killed the people of the LORD.

016:042 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered
        against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the
        tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered
        it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.

016:043 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

016:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

016:045 Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume
        them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.

016:046 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein
        from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto
        the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is
        wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.

016:047 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of
        the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the
        people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the
        people.

016:048 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague
        was stayed.

016:049 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
        seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of
        Korah.

016:050 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle
        of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

017:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of
        them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all
        their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve
        rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.

017:003 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for
        one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

017:004 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the
        congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

017:005 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall
        choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the
        murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur
        against you.

017:006 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of
        their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one,
        according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the
        rod of Aaron was among their rods.

017:007 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle
        of witness.

017:008 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
        tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the
        house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed
        blossoms, and yielded almonds.

017:009 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto
        all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every
        man his rod.

017:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before
        the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and
        thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they
        die not.

017:011 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.

017:012 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold,
        we die, we perish, we all perish.

017:013 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the
        LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

018:001 And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy
        father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the
        sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the
        iniquity of your priesthood.

018:002 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy
        father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto
        thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee
        shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.

018:003 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the
        tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the
        sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.

018:004 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the
        tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.

018:005 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge
        of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the
        children of Israel.

018:006 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from
        among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift
        for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

018:007 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's
        office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and
        ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as
        a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be
        put to death.

018:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee
        the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things
        of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by
        reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for
        ever.

018:009 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the
        fire: every oblation of their's, every meat offering of
        their's, and every sin offering of their's, and every trespass
        offering of their's which they shall render unto me, shall be
        most holy for thee and for thy sons.

018:010 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat
        it: it shall be holy unto thee.

018:011 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all
        the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given
        them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with
        thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy
        house shall eat of it.

018:012 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of
        the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto
        the LORD, them have I given thee.

018:013 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall
        bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean
        in thine house shall eat of it.

018:014 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.

018:015 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they
        bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be
        thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely
        redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.

018:016 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
        redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five
        shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty
        gerahs.

018:017 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or
        the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy:
        thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn
        their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour
        unto the LORD.

018:018 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and
        as the right shoulder are thine.

018:019 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children
        of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons
        and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a
        covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy
        seed with thee.

018:020 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance
        in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I
        am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of
        Israel.

018:021 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth
        in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they
        serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

018:022 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
        tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.

018:023 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be
        a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the
        children of Israel they have no inheritance.

018:024 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as
        an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites
        to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the
        children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.

018:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

018:026 Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take
        of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you
        from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an
        heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the
        tithe.

018:027 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as
        though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the
        fulness of the winepress.

018:028 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of
        all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel;
        and ye shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron
        the priest.

018:029 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of
        the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part
        thereof out of it.

018:030 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the
        best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the
        Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the
        increase of the winepress.

018:031 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households:
        for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of
        the congregation.

018:032 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved
        from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy
        things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.

019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

019:002 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath
        commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that
        they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no
        blemish, and upon which never came yoke:

019:003 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may
        bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her
        before his face:

019:004 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his
        finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the
        tabernacle of the congregation seven times:

019:005 And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her
        flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:

019:006 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet,
        and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

019:007 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his
        flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and
        the priest shall be unclean until the even.

019:008 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and
        bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.

019:009 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the
        heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and
        it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of
        Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for
        sin.

019:010 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
        clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto
        the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth
        among them, for a statute for ever.

019:011 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean
        seven days.

019:012 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the
        seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself
        the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.

019:013 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and
        purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD;
        and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water
        of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean;
        his uncleanness is yet upon him.

019:014 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come
        into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean
        seven days.

019:015 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it,
        is unclean.

019:016 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the
        open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave,
        shall be unclean seven days.

019:017 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the
        burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall
        be put thereto in a vessel:

019:018 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water,
        and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and
        upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a
        bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:

019:019 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the
        third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he
        shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself
        in water, and shall be clean at even.

019:020 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify
        himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the
        congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the
        LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon
        him; he is unclean.

019:021 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that
        sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and
        he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean
        until even.

019:022 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean;
        and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.

020:001 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
        into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people
        abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.

020:002 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered
        themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

020:003 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God
        that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!

020:004 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into
        this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?

020:005 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to
        bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or
        of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any
        water to drink.

020:006 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly
        unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they
        fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto
        them.

020:007 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

020:008 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and
        Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their
        eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring
        forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the
        congregation and their beasts drink.

020:009 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded
        him.

020:010 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before
        the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we
        fetch you water out of this rock?

020:011 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the
        rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the
        congregation drank, and their beasts also.

020:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed
        me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel,
        therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land
        which I have given them.

020:013 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel
        strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.

020:014 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
        Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail
        that hath befallen us:

020:015 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in
        Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our
        fathers:

020:016 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent
        an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold,
        we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:

020:017 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not
        pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither
        will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the
        king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the
        left, until we have passed thy borders.

020:018 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come
        out against thee with the sword.

020:019 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the
        high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I
        will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go
        through on my feet.

020:020 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out
        against him with much people, and with a strong hand.

020:021 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
        wherefore Israel turned away from him.

020:022 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
        journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

020:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the
        coast of the land of Edom, saying,

020:024 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not
        enter into the land which I have given unto the children of
        Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of
        Meribah.

020:025 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount
        Hor:

020:026 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his
        son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall
        die there.

020:027 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into
        mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.

020:028 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon
        Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount:
        and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

020:029 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they
        mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

021:001 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south,
        heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he
        fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.

021:002 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt
        indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly
        destroy their cities.

021:003 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered
        up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their
        cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.

021:004 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea,
        to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was
        much discouraged because of the way.

021:005 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore
        have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?
        for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our
        soul loatheth this light bread.

021:006 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they
        bit the people; and much people of Israel died.

021:007 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,
        for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray
        unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And
        Moses prayed for the people.

021:008 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and
        set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one
        that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

021:009 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and
        it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he
        beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

021:010 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

021:011 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in
        the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

021:012 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

021:013 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
        Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the
        coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab,
        between Moab and the Amorites.

021:014 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
        he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,

021:015 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the
        dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.

021:016 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof
        the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I
        will give them water.

021:017 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto
        it:

021:018 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged
        it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And
        from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:

021:019 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:

021:020 And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab,
        to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.

021:021 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
        saying,

021:022 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the
        fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters
        of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way,
        until we be past thy borders.

021:023 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:
        but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out
        against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and
        fought against Israel.

021:024 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed
        his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of
        Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.

021:025 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the
        cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages
        thereof.

021:026 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites,
        who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all
        his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.

021:027 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
        let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:

021:028 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city
        of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the
        high places of Arnon.

021:029 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he
        hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into
        captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.

021:030 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and
        we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto
        Medeba.

021:031 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

021:032 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
        thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

021:033 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the
        king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people,
        to the battle at Edrei.

021:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have
        delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land;
        and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
        Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

021:035 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until
        there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

022:001 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the
        plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

022:002 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to
        the Amorites.

022:003 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were
        many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of
        Israel.

022:004 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this
        company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh
        up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was
        king of the Moabites at that time.

022:005 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
        Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of
        his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people
        come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth,
        and they abide over against me:

022:006 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for
        they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that
        we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land:
        for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom
        thou cursest is cursed.

022:007 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with
        the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto
        Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.

022:008 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring
        you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the
        princes of Moab abode with Balaam.

022:009 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with
        thee?

022:010 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of
        Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,

022:011 Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth
        the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I
        shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.

022:012 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
        shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.

022:013 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes
        of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to
        give me leave to go with you.

022:014 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and
        said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

022:015 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable
        than they.

022:016 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the
        son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from
        coming unto me:

022:017 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do
        whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee,
        curse me this people.

022:018 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
        Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
        cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or
        more.

022:019 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that
        I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.

022:020 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the
        men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the
        word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.

022:021 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
        went with the princes of Moab.

022:022 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of
        the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he
        was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.

022:023 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and
        his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of
        the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to
        turn her into the way.

022:024 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a
        wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.

022:025 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself
        unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and
        he smote her again.

022:026 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow
        place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to
        the left.

022:027 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down
        under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the
        ass with a staff.

022:028 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
        Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me
        these three times?

022:029 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I
        would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill
        thee.

022:030 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which
        thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I
        ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

022:031 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel
        of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his
        hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.

022:032 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
        smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to
        withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:

022:033 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times:
        unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain
        thee, and saved her alive.

022:034 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for
        I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now
        therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.

022:035 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men:
        but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou
        shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

022:036 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
        him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon,
        which is in the utmost coast.

022:037 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee
        to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able
        indeed to promote thee to honour?

022:038 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I
        now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God
        putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.

022:039 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.

022:040 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to
        the princes that were with him.

022:041 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
        brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he
        might see the utmost part of the people.

023:001 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
        prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.

023:002 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam
        offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.

023:003 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I
        will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and
        whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an
        high place.

023:004 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared
        seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock
        and a ram.

023:005 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return
        unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

023:006 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt
        sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.

023:007 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab
        hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,
        saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.

023:008 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I
        defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?

023:009 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I
        behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be
        reckoned among the nations.

023:010 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
        part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let
        my last end be like his!

023:011 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I
        took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast
        blessed them altogether.

023:012 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that
        which the LORD hath put in my mouth?

023:013 And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto
        another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt
        see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all:
        and curse me them from thence.

023:014 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
        Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a
        ram on every altar.

023:015 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering,
        while I meet the LORD yonder.

023:016 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and
        said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.

023:017 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt
        offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said
        unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?

023:018 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and
        hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:

023:019 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man,
        that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it?
        or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

023:020 Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath
        blessed; and I cannot reverse it.

023:021 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
        perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the
        shout of a king is among them.

023:022 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength
        of an unicorn.

023:023 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there
        any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall
        be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

023:024 Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up
        himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of
        the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

023:025 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor
        bless them at all.

023:026 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
        saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?

023:027 And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring
        thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that
        thou mayest curse me them from thence.

023:028 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh
        toward Jeshimon.

023:029 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
        prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

023:030 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a
        ram on every altar.

024:001 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel,
        he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but
        he set his face toward the wilderness.

024:002 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in
        his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God
        came upon him.

024:003 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
        hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

024:004 He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the
        vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his
        eyes open:

024:005 How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O
        Israel!

024:006 As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the
        river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath
        planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.

024:007 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall
        be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and
        his kingdom shall be exalted.

024:008 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the
        strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his
        enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through
        with his arrows.

024:009 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who
        shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and
        cursed is he that curseth thee.

024:010 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his
        hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to
        curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed
        them these three times.

024:011 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote
        thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back
        from honour.

024:012 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers
        which thou sentest unto me, saying,

024:013 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
        cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either
        good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that
        will I speak?

024:014 And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I
        will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in
        the latter days.

024:015 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
        hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

024:016 He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the
        knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the
        Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:

024:017 I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not
        nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre
        shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab,
        and destroy all the children of Sheth.

024:018 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a
        possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.

024:019 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall
        destroy him that remaineth of the city.

024:020 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and
        said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end
        shall be that he perish for ever.

024:021 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and
        said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest
        in a rock.

024:022 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall
        carry thee away captive.

024:023 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live
        when God doeth this!

024:024 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall
        afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall
        perish for ever.

024:025 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and
        Balak also went his way.

025:001 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit
        whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

025:002 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods:
        and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.

025:003 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the
        LORD was kindled against Israel.

025:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the
        people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that
        the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.

025:005 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one
        his men that were joined unto Baalpeor.

025:006 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought
        unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses,
        and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of
        Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of
        the congregation.

025:007 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the
        priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and
        took a javelin in his hand;

025:008 And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust
        both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through
        her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of
        Israel.

025:009 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four
        thousand.

025:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

025:011 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
        hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while
        he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the
        children of Israel in my jealousy.

025:012 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:

025:013 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the
        covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous
        for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.

025:014 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was
        slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu,
        a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.

025:015 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was
        Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of
        a chief house in Midian.

025:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

025:017 Vex the Midianites, and smite them:

025:018 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have
        beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of
        Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which
        was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.

026:001 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto
        Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,

026:002 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of
        Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their
        fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.

026:003 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains
        of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

026:004 Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward;
        as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which
        went forth out of the land of Egypt.

026:005 Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben;
        Hanoch, of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu,

        numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven
        hundred and thirty.

026:008 And the sons of Pallu; Eliab.

026:009 And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This is
        that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation,
        who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of
        Korah, when they strove against the LORD:

026:010 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together
        with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire
        devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.

        thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty.

026:052 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

026:053 Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance
        according to the number of names.

026:054 To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou
        shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his
        inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of
        him.

026:055 Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to
        the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.

026:056 According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided
        between many and few.

026:057 And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after
        their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites: of
        Kohath, the family of the Kohathites: of Merari, the family of
        the Merarites.

026:058 These are the families of the Levites: the family of the
        Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the
        Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the
        Korathites. And Kohath begat Amram.

026:059 And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of
        Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt: and she bare unto
        Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.

026:060 And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and
        Ithamar.

026:061 And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire
        before the LORD.

026:062 And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three
        thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were
        not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was
        no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.

026:063 These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the
        priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of
        Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

026:064 But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and
        Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of
        Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.

026:065 For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the
        wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb
        the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

027:001 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the
        son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the
        families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the
        names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah,
        and Tirzah.

027:002 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest,
        and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door
        of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

027:003 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the
        company of them that gathered themselves together against the
        LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had
        no sons.

027:004 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his
        family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a
        possession among the brethren of our father.

027:005 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.

027:006 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

027:007 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely
        give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's
        brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father
        to pass unto them.

027:008 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a
        man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance
        to pass unto his daughter.

027:009 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance
        unto his brethren.

027:010 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance
        unto his father's brethren.

027:011 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his
        inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his
        family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the
        children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

027:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount
        Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children
        of Israel.

027:013 And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto
        thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.

027:014 For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin,
        in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water
        before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in
        the wilderness of Zin.

027:015 And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,

027:016 Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man
        over the congregation,

027:017 Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them,
        and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that
        the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no
        shepherd.

027:018 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun,
        a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;

027:019 And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
        congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

027:020 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the
        congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

027:021 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask
        counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at
        his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come
        in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all
        the congregation.

027:022 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua,
        and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
        congregation:

027:023 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the
        LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

028:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

028:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My
        offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a
        sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in
        their due season.

028:003 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by
        fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the
        first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt
        offering.

028:004 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other
        lamb shalt thou offer at even;

028:005 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering,
        mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.

028:006 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount
        Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the
        LORD.

028:007 And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an
        hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the
        strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.

028:008 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat
        offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof,
        thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet
        savour unto the LORD.

028:009 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without
        spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering,
        mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:

028:010 This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the
        continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

028:011 And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt
        offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven
        lambs of the first year without spot;

028:012 And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled
        with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a
        meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;

028:013 And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat
        offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet
        savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

028:014 And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a
        bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth
        part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of
        every month throughout the months of the year.

028:015 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD
        shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his
        drink offering.

028:016 And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover
        of the LORD.

028:017 And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven
        days shall unleavened bread be eaten.

028:018 In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no
        manner of servile work therein:

028:019 But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt
        offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and
        seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without
        blemish:

028:020 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil:
        three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth
        deals for a ram;

028:021 A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb,
        throughout the seven lambs:

028:022 And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.

028:023 Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning,
        which is for a continual burnt offering.

028:024 After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven
        days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet
        savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual
        burnt offering, and his drink offering.

028:025 And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye
        shall do no servile work.

028:026 Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat
        offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have
        an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:

028:027 But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto
        the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the
        first year;

028:028 And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth
        deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,

028:029 A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven
        lambs;

028:030 And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.

028:031 Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and
        his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish)
        and their drink offerings.

029:001 And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye
        shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:
        it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.

029:002 And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto
        the LORD; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the
        first year without blemish:

029:003 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
        three tenth deals for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a
        ram,

029:004 And one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

029:005 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an
        atonement for you:

029:006 Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering,
        and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their
        drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet
        savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

029:007 And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an
        holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall
        not do any work therein:

029:008 But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet
        savour; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the
        first year; they shall be unto you without blemish:

029:009 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
        three tenth deals to a bullock, and two tenth deals to one
        ram,

029:010 A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

029:011 One kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the sin
        offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and
        the meat offering of it, and their drink offerings.

029:012 And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an
        holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall
        keep a feast unto the LORD seven days:

029:013 And ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire,
        of a sweet savour unto the LORD; thirteen young bullocks, two
        rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be
        without blemish:

029:014 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
        three tenth deals unto every bullock of the thirteen bullocks,
        two tenth deals to each ram of the two rams,

029:015 And a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourteen lambs:

029:016 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
        continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink
        offering.

029:017 And on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks,
        two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without spot:

029:018 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:019 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
        continual burnt offering, and the meat offering thereof, and
        their drink offerings.

029:020 And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs
        of the first year without blemish;

029:021 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:022 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:023 And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
        lambs of the first year without blemish:

029:024 Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:025 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
        continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink
        offering.

029:026 And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
        lambs of the first year without spot:

029:027 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:028 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:029 And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
        lambs of the first year without blemish:

029:030 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:031 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:032 And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
        lambs of the first year without blemish:

029:033 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:034 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:035 On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do
        no servile work therein:

029:036 But ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire,
        of a sweet savour unto the LORD: one bullock, one ram, seven
        lambs of the first year without blemish:

029:037 Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock,
        for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their
        number, after the manner:

029:038 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:039 These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts,
        beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt
        offerings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink
        offerings, and for your peace offerings.

029:040 And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that
        the LORD commanded Moses.

030:001 And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the
        children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD
        hath commanded.

030:002 If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his
        soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do
        according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.

030:003 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a
        bond, being in her father's house in her youth;

030:004 And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath
        bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her;
        then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she
        hath bound her soul shall stand.

030:005 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not
        any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her
        soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her
        father disallowed her.

030:006 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered
        ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;

030:007 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day
        that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds
        wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

030:008 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it;
        then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she
        uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none
        effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.

030:009 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced,
        wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against
        her.

030:010 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by
        a bond with an oath;

030:011 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and
        disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every
        bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

030:012 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he
        heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips
        concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall
        not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall
        forgive her.

030:013 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her
        husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

030:014 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day
        to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds,
        which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his
        peace at her in the day that he heard them.

030:015 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath
        heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.

030:016 These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses,
        between a man and his wife, between the father and his
        daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.

031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

031:002 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward
        shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.

031:003 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of
        yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the
        Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.

031:004 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of
        Israel, shall ye send to the war.

031:005 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a
        thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

031:006 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe,
        them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war,
        with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his
        hand.

031:007 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded
        Moses; and they slew all the males.

031:008 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them
        that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and
        Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they
        slew with the sword.

031:009 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian
        captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all
        their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.

031:010 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all
        their goodly castles, with fire.

031:011 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and
        of beasts.

031:012 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil,
        unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation
        of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of
        Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.

031:013 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the
        congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.

031:014 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the
        captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which
        came from the battle.

031:015 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?

031:016 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the
        counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the
        matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation
        of the LORD.

031:017 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill
        every woman that hath known man by lying with him.

031:018 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying
        with him, keep alive for yourselves.

031:019 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath
        killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain,
        purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and
        on the seventh day.

031:020 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins,
        and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.

031:021 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to
        the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD
        commanded Moses;

031:022 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin,
        and the lead,

031:023 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go
        through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall
        be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth
        not the fire ye shall make go through the water.

031:024 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye
        shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.

031:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

031:026 Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of
        beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of
        the congregation:

031:027 And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the
        war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the
        congregation:

031:028 And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went
        out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons,
        and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:

031:029 Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest,
        for an heave offering of the LORD.

031:030 And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one
        portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses,
        and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto
        the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
        LORD.

031:031 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

031:032 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war
        had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and
        five thousand sheep,

031:033 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,

031:034 And threescore and one thousand asses,

031:035 And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had
        not known man by lying with him.

031:036 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to
        war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty
        thousand and five hundred sheep:

031:037 And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and
        threescore and fifteen.

031:038 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the
        LORD's tribute was threescore and twelve.

031:039 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which
        the LORD's tribute was threescore and one.

031:040 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's
        tribute was thirty and two persons.

031:041 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave
        offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

031:042 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from
        the men that warred,

031:043 (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three
        hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and
        five hundred sheep,

031:044 And thirty and six thousand beeves,

031:045 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,

031:046 And sixteen thousand persons;)

031:047 Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion
        of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the
        Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD;
        as the LORD commanded Moses.

031:048 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the
        captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near
        unto Moses:

031:049 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of
        the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh
        not one man of us.

031:050 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every
        man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets,
        rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our
        souls before the LORD.

031:051 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even
        all wrought jewels.

031:052 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the
        LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of
        hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty
        shekels.

031:053 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)

031:054 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains
        of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the
        tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the
        children of Israel before the LORD.

032:001 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very
        great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of
        Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a
        place for cattle;

032:002 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake
        unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of
        the congregation, saying,

032:003 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and
        Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

032:004 Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation
        of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:

032:005 Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let
        this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and
        bring us not over Jordan.

032:006 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of
        Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?

032:007 And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of
        Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given
        them?

032:008 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to
        see the land.

032:009 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the
        land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel,
        that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given
        them.

032:010 And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
        saying,

032:011 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty
        years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto
        Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not
        wholly followed me:

032:012 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the
        son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.

032:013 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
        them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the
        generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was
        consumed.

032:014 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an
        increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the
        LORD toward Israel.

032:015 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave
        them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.

032:016 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build
        sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little
        ones:

032:017 But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of
        Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our
        little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the
        inhabitants of the land.

032:018 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of
        Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.

032:019 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or
        forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side
        Jordan eastward.

032:020 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will
        go armed before the LORD to war,

032:021 And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD,
        until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,

032:022 And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye
        shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before
        Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the
        LORD.

032:023 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the
        LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.

032:024 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your
        sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.

032:025 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto
        Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.

032:026 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,
        shall be there in the cities of Gilead:

032:027 But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war,
        before the Lord to battle, as my lord saith.

032:028 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and
        Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of
        the children of Israel:

032:029 And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the
        children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man
        armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be
        subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead
        for a possession:

032:030 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
        possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

032:031 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,
        saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we
        do.

032:032 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of
        Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side
        Jordan may be our's.

032:033 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to
        the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh
        the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,
        and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the
        cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country
        round about.

032:034 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

032:035 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,

032:036 And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for
        sheep.

032:037 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and
        Kirjathaim,

032:038 And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and
        Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they
        builded.

032:039 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,
        and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.

032:040 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he
        dwelt therein.

032:041 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns
        thereof, and called them Havothjair.

032:042 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and
        called it Nobah, after his own name.

033:001 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went
        forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the
        hand of Moses and Aaron.

033:002 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys
        by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys
        according to their goings out.

033:003 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the
        fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the
        passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in
        the sight of all the Egyptians.

033:004 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD
        had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed
        judgments.

033:005 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched
        in Succoth.

033:006 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is
        in the edge of the wilderness.

033:007 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth,
        which is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.

033:008 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through
        the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days'
        journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.

033:009 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim
        were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm
        trees; and they pitched there.

033:010 And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.

033:011 And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the
        wilderness of Sin.

033:012 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and
        encamped in Dophkah.

033:013 And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.

033:014 And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where
        was no water for the people to drink.

033:015 And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness
        of Sinai.

033:016 And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at
        Kibrothhattaavah.

033:017 And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped at
        Hazeroth.

033:018 And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.

033:019 And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.

033:020 And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah.

033:021 And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.

033:022 And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.

033:023 And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.

033:024 And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.

033:025 And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.

033:026 And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.

033:027 And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.

033:028 And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.

033:029 And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.

033:030 And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.

033:031 And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.

033:032 And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.

033:033 And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.

033:034 And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.

033:035 And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.

033:036 And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the
        wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.

033:037 And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the
        edge of the land of Edom.

033:038 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment
        of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the
        children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the
        first day of the fifth month.

033:039 And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when
        he died in mount Hor.

033:040 And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the
        land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

033:041 And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.

033:042 And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.

033:043 And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.

033:044 And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the
        border of Moab.

033:045 And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.

033:046 And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in
        Almondiblathaim.

033:047 And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the
        mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.

033:048 And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in
        the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

033:049 And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto
        Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.

033:050 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
        near Jericho, saying,

033:051 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

033:052 Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from
        before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all
        their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high
        places:

033:053 And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell
        therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.

033:054 And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among
        your families: and to the more ye shall give the more
        inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less
        inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place
        where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers
        ye shall inherit.

033:055 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from
        before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye
        let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in
        your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

033:056 Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I
        thought to do unto them.

034:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

034:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall
        fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with
        the coasts thereof:)

034:003 Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin
        along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the
        outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:

034:004 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of
        Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof
        shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to
        Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:

034:005 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river
        of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.

034:006 And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great
        sea for a border: this shall be your west border.

034:007 And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye
        shall point out for you mount Hor:

034:008 From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the
        entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall
        be to Zedad:

034:009 And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of
        it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.

034:010 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to
        Shepham:

034:011 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the
        east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall
        reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:

034:012 And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of
        it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the
        coasts thereof round about.

034:013 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is
        the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD
        commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:

034:014 For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house
        of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad
        according to the house of their fathers, have received their
        inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received
        their inheritance:

034:015 The two tribes and the half tribe have received their
        inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward
        the sunrising.

034:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

034:017 These are the names of the men which shall divide the land
        unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

034:018 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the
        land by inheritance.

034:019 And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah,
        Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

034:020 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of
        Ammihud.

034:021 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

034:022 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the
        son of Jogli.

034:023 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the
        children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

034:024 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel
        the son of Shiphtan.

034:025 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun,
        Elizaphan the son of Parnach.

034:026 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar,
        Paltiel the son of Azzan.

034:027 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud
        the son of Shelomi.

034:028 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali,
        Pedahel the son of Ammihud.

034:029 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the
        inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

035:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
        near Jericho, saying,

035:002 Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the
        Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell
        in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the
        cities round about them.

035:003 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of
        them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for
        all their beasts.

035:004 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the
        Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a
        thousand cubits round about.

035:005 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side
        two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand
        cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the
        north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the
        midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.

035:006 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites
        there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint
        for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye
        shall add forty and two cities.

035:007 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be
        forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.

035:008 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession
        of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall
        give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few:
        every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according
        to his inheritance which he inheriteth.

035:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

035:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

035:011 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for
        you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any
        person at unawares.

035:012 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger;
        that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the
        congregation in judgment.

035:013 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye
        have for refuge.

035:014 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three
        cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be
        cities of refuge.

035:015 These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of
        Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among
        them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee
        thither.

035:016 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he
        die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to
        death.

035:017 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may
        die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely
        be put to death.

035:018 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he
        may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall
        surely be put to death.

035:019 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he
        meeteth him, he shall slay him.

035:020 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of
        wait, that he die;

035:021 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that
        smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer:
        the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth
        him.

035:022 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast
        upon him any thing without laying of wait,

035:023 Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not,
        and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy,
        neither sought his harm:

035:024 Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the
        revenger of blood according to these judgments:

035:025 And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand
        of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore
        him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he
        shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was
        anointed with the holy oil.

035:026 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of
        the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;

035:027 And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the
        city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer;
        he shall not be guilty of blood:

035:028 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge
        until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the
        high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his
        possession.

035:029 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you
        throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

035:030 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death
        by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify
        against any person to cause him to die.

035:031 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a
        murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put
        to death.

035:032 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the
        city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the
        land, until the death of the priest.

035:033 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it
        defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the
        blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed
        it.

035:034 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein
        I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

036:001 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of
        Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the
        families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before
        Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the
        children of Israel:

036:002 And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for
        an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord
        was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of
        Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.

036:003 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes
        of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be
        taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to
        the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so
        shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.

036:004 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then
        shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the
        tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance
        be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our
        fathers.

036:005 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the
        word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath
        said well.

036:006 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the
        daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they
        think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father
        shall they marry.

036:007 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove
        from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel
        shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his
        fathers.

036:008 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any
        tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the
        family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel
        may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.

036:009 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another
        tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel
        shall keep himself to his own inheritance.

036:010 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of
        Zelophehad:

036:011 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the
        daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's
        brothers' sons:

036:012 And they were married into the families of the sons of
        Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in
        the tribe of the family of their father.

036:013 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD
        commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in
        the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

Book 05	Deuteronomy

001:001 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this
        side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the
        Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth,
        and Dizahab.

001:002 (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount
        Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)

001:003 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh
        month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto
        the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had
        given him in commandment unto them;

001:004 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt
        in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth
        in Edrei:

001:005 On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to
        declare this law, saying,

001:006 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt
        long enough in this mount:

001:007 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the
        Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the
        plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by
        the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon,
        unto the great river, the river Euphrates.

001:008 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the
        land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
        and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.

001:009 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to
        bear you myself alone:

001:010 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are
        this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.

001:011 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so
        many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)

001:012 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden,
        and your strife?

001:013 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your
        tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.

001:014 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken
        is good for us to do.

001:015 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and
        made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and
        captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and
        captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.

001:016 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the
        causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between
        every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.

001:017 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear
        the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the
        face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is
        too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.

001:018 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye
        should do.

001:019 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that
        great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the
        mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us;
        and we came to Kadeshbarnea.

001:020 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the
        Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.

001:021 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up
        and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto
        thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.

001:022 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will
        send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and
        bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what
        cities we shall come.

001:023 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you,
        one of a tribe:

001:024 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto
        the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

001:025 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and
        brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said,
        It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.

001:026 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
        commandment of the LORD your God:

001:027 And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD
        hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,
        to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

001:028 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our
        heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the
        cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have
        seen the sons of the Anakims there.

001:029 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.

001:030 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for
        you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your
        eyes;

001:031 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD
        thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way
        that ye went, until ye came into this place.

001:032 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,

001:033 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to
        pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way
        ye should go, and in a cloud by day.

001:034 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
        sware, saying,

001:035 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil
        generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your
        fathers.

001:036 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him
        will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his
        children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.

001:037 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou
        also shalt not go in thither.

001:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he
        shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel
        to inherit it.

001:039 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and
        your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good
        and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give
        it, and they shall possess it.

001:040 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
        wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

001:041 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the
        LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD
        our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his
        weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.

001:042 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither
        fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your
        enemies.

001:043 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled
        against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously
        up into the hill.

001:044 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out
        against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in
        Seir, even unto Hormah.

001:045 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would
        not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

001:046 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that
        ye abode there.

002:001 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by
        the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we
        compassed mount Seir many days.

002:002 And the LORD spake unto me, saying,

002:003 Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you
        northward.

002:004 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through
        the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell
        in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed
        unto yourselves therefore:

002:005 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land,
        no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount
        Seir unto Esau for a possession.

002:006 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye
        shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.

002:007 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy
        hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness:
        these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou
        hast lacked nothing.

002:008 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,
        which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath,
        and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the
        wilderness of Moab.

002:009 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither
        contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their
        land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the
        children of Lot for a possession.

002:010 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and
        many, and tall, as the Anakims;

002:011 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the
        Moabites called them Emims.

002:012 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of
        Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before
        them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of
        his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.

002:013 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we
        went over the brook Zered.

002:014 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we
        were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years;
        until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out
        from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.

002:015 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy
        them from among the host, until they were consumed.

002:016 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and
        dead from among the people,

002:017 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,

002:018 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:

002:019 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
        distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give
        thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession;
        because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a
        possession.

002:020 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt
        therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;

002:021 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the
        LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and
        dwelt in their stead:

002:022 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when
        he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded
        them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:

002:023 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the
        Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them,
        and dwelt in their stead.)

002:024 Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:
        behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king
        of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend
        with him in battle.

002:025 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
        thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who
        shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in
        anguish because of thee.

002:026 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
        Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,

002:027 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way,
        I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.

002:028 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me
        water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on
        my feet;

002:029 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
        which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over
        Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.

002:030 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for
        the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart
        obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as
        appeareth this day.

002:031 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon
        and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest
        inherit his land.

002:032 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to
        fight at Jahaz.

002:033 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote
        him, and his sons, and all his people.

002:034 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
        the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we
        left none to remain:

002:035 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the
        spoil of the cities which we took.

002:036 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and
        from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there
        was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered
        all unto us:

002:037 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not,
        nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in
        the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

003:001 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king
        of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to
        battle at Edrei.

003:002 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver
        him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou
        shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
        Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

003:003 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king
        of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was
        left to him remaining.

003:004 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city
        which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region
        of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

003:005 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;
        beside unwalled towns a great many.

003:006 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of
        Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of
        every city.

003:007 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a
        prey to ourselves.

003:008 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of
        the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the
        river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;

003:009 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call
        it Shenir;)

003:010 All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,
        unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

003:011 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
        behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in
        Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length
        thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of
        a man.

003:012 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer,
        which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the
        cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

003:013 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of
        Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of
        Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.

003:014 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto
        the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his
        own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.

003:015 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

003:016 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from
        Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the
        border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the
        children of Ammon;

003:017 The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from
        Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea,
        under Ashdothpisgah eastward.

003:018 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God
        hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over
        armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that
        are meet for the war.

003:019 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I
        know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities
        which I have given you;

003:020 Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as
        unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD
        your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye
        return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.

003:021 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have
        seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two
        kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou
        passest.

003:022 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight
        for you.

003:023 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,

003:024 O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness,
        and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in
        earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to
        thy might?

003:025 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is
        beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

003:026 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not
        hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak
        no more unto me of this matter.

003:027 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes
        westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and
        behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this
        Jordan.

003:028 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for
        he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them
        to inherit the land which thou shalt see.

003:029 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.

004:001 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto
        the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may
        live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of
        your fathers giveth you.

004:002 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither
        shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the
        commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

004:003 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for
        all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath
        destroyed them from among you.

004:004 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every
        one of you this day.

004:005 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the
        LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land
        whither ye go to possess it.

004:006 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
        understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear
        all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a
        wise and understanding people.

004:007 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto
        them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon
        him for?

004:008 And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and
        judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you
        this day?

004:009 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest
        thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest
        they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach
        them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;

004:010 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God
        in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people
        together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may
        learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the
        earth, and that they may teach their children.

004:011 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the
        mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with
        darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.

004:012 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye
        heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye
        heard a voice.

004:013 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you
        to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two
        tables of stone.

004:014 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes
        and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go
        over to possess it.

004:015 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no
        manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you
        in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:

004:016 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the
        similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

004:017 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness
        of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,

004:018 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the
        likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:

004:019 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou
        seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host
        of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve
        them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations
        under the whole heaven.

004:020 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the
        iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of
        inheritance, as ye are this day.

004:021 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and
        sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not
        go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
        for an inheritance:

004:022 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye
        shall go over, and possess that good land.

004:023 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the
        LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven
        image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God
        hath forbidden thee.

004:024 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.

004:025 When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and
        ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt
        yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any
        thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to
        provoke him to anger:

004:026 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that
        ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go
        over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon
        it, but shall utterly be destroyed.

004:027 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall
        be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD
        shall lead you.

004:028 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood
        and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

004:029 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou
        shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with
        all thy soul.

004:030 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come
        upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD
        thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;

004:031 (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake
        thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy
        fathers which he sware unto them.

004:032 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,
        since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask
        from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath
        been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard
        like it?

004:033 Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the
        midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?

004:034 Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst
        of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders,
        and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm,
        and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God
        did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

004:035 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD
        he is God; there is none else beside him.

004:036 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might
        instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire;
        and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.

004:037 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their
        seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his
        mighty power out of Egypt;

004:038 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier
        than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for
        an inheritance, as it is this day.

004:039 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that
        the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth
        beneath: there is none else.

004:040 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,
        which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee,
        and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong
        thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee,
        for ever.

004:041 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the
        sunrising;

004:042 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his
        neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that
        fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:

004:043 Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the
        Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in
        Bashan, of the Manassites.

004:044 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of
        Israel:

004:045 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the
        judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
        after they came forth out of Egypt.

004:046 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in
        the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon,
        whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were
        come forth out of Egypt:

004:047 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of
        Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side
        Jordan toward the sunrising;

004:048 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto
        mount Sion, which is Hermon,

004:049 And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the
        sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

005:001 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O
        Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears
        this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.

005:002 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

005:003 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
        even us, who are all of us here alive this day.

005:004 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the
        midst of the fire,

005:005 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you
        the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the
        fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,

005:006 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
        Egypt, from the house of bondage.

005:007 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

005:008 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of
        any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
        beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:

005:009 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for
        I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
        the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
        generation of them that hate me,

005:010 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep
        my commandments.

005:011 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for
        the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
        vain.

005:012 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath
        commanded thee.

005:013 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:

005:014 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it
        thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
        daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine
        ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger
        that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy
        maidservant may rest as well as thou.

005:015 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,
        and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a
        mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy
        God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.

005:016 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath
        commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it
        may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God
        giveth thee.

005:017 Thou shalt not kill.

005:018 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.

005:019 Neither shalt thou steal.

005:020 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.

005:021 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt
        thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his
        manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any
        thing that is thy neighbour's.

005:022 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount
        out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick
        darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he
        wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.

005:023 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst
        of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that
        ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and
        your elders;

005:024 And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory
        and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the
        midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk
        with man, and he liveth.

005:025 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will
        consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more,
        then we shall die.

005:026 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of
        the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we
        have, and lived?

005:027 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say:
        and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak
        unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.

005:028 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto
        me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the
        words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they
        have well said all that they have spoken.

005:029 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear
        me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well
        with them, and with their children for ever!

005:030 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.

005:031 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto
        thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the
        judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them
        in the land which I give them to possess it.

005:032 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath
        commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to
        the left.

005:033 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath
        commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with
        you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye
        shall possess.

006:001 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the
        judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you,
        that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:

006:002 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his
        statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and
        thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that
        thy days may be prolonged.

006:003 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be
        well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD
        God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that
        floweth with milk and honey.

006:004 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:

006:005 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and
        with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

006:006 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in
        thine heart:

006:007 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and
        shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
        thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when
        thou risest up.

006:008 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they
        shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.

006:009 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on
        thy gates.

006:010 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee
        into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to
        Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities,
        which thou buildedst not,

006:011 And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not,
        and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive
        trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten
        and be full;

006:012 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee
        forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

006:013 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt
        swear by his name.

006:014 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people
        which are round about you;

006:015 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the
        anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy
        thee from off the face of the earth.

006:016 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in
        Massah.

006:017 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your
        God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath
        commanded thee.

006:018 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of
        the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest
        go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy
        fathers.

006:019 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD
        hath spoken.

006:020 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What
        mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments,
        which the LORD our God hath commanded you?

006:021 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in
        Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty
        hand:

006:022 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon
        Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our
        eyes:

006:023 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in,
        to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.

006:024 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear
        the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve
        us alive, as it is at this day.

006:025 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all
        these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath
        commanded us.

007:001 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither
        thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations
        before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the
        Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the
        Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier
        than thou;

007:002 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou
        shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no
        covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:

007:003 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou
        shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take
        unto thy son.

007:004 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they
        may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled
        against you, and destroy thee suddenly.

007:005 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their
        altars, and break down their images, and cut down their
        groves, and burn their graven images with fire.

007:006 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD
        thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself,
        above all people that are upon the face of the earth.

007:007 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you,
        because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were
        the fewest of all people:

007:008 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the
        oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD
        brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of
        the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

007:009 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful
        God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him
        and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;

007:010 And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy
        them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will
        repay him to his face.

007:011 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes,
        and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.

007:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these
        judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall
        keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto
        thy fathers:

007:013 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he
        will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy
        land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of
        thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he
        sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

007:014 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be
        male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.

007:015 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will
        put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest,
        upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.

007:016 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God
        shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them:
        neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare
        unto thee.

007:017 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than
        I; how can I dispossess them?

007:018 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what
        the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;

007:019 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and
        the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm,
        whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD
        thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.

007:020 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them,
        until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be
        destroyed.

007:021 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is
        among you, a mighty God and terrible.

007:022 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by
        little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest
        the beasts of the field increase upon thee.

007:023 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall
        destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be
        destroyed.

007:024 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou
        shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man
        be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.

007:025 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou
        shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take
        it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an
        abomination to the LORD thy God.

007:026 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest
        thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest
        it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

008:001 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye
        observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and
        possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.

008:002 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led
        thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and
        to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou
        wouldest keep his commandments, or no.

008:003 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee
        with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers
        know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by
        bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth
        of the LORD doth man live.

008:004 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot
        swell, these forty years.

008:005 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man
        chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.

008:006 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy
        God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.

008:007 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of
        brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of
        valleys and hills;

008:008 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and
        pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;

008:009 A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou
        shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron,
        and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.

008:010 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the
        LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.

008:011 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping
        his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I
        command thee this day:

008:012 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly
        houses, and dwelt therein;

008:013 And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and
        thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;

008:014 Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy
        God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from
        the house of bondage;

008:015 Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness,
        wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where
        there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the
        rock of flint;

008:016 Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers
        knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove
        thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;

008:017 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine
        hand hath gotten me this wealth.

008:018 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that
        giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his
        covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

008:019 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God,
        and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I
        testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.

008:020 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so
        shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the
        voice of the LORD your God.

009:001 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go
        in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself,
        cities great and fenced up to heaven,

009:002 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom
        thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand
        before the children of Anak!

009:003 Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he
        which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall
        destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so
        shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the
        LORD hath said unto thee.

009:004 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God
        hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my
        righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this
        land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth
        drive them out from before thee.

009:005 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine
        heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the
        wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them
        out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which
        the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

009:006 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not
        this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou
        art a stiffnecked people.

009:007 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God
        to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst
        depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this
        place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.

009:008 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD
        was angry with you to have destroyed you.

009:009 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of
        stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made
        with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty
        nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:

009:010 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written
        with the finger of God; and on them was written according to
        all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out
        of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

009:011 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
        that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables
        of the covenant.

009:012 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from
        hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of
        Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside
        out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a
        molten image.

009:013 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this
        people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

009:014 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name
        from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier
        and greater than they.

009:015 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned
        with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two
        hands.

009:016 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your
        God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside
        quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.

009:017 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands,
        and brake them before your eyes.

009:018 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days
        and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water,
        because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in
        the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

009:019 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith
        the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD
        hearkened unto me at that time also.

009:020 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him:
        and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.

009:021 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it
        with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even
        until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof
        into the brook that descended out of the mount.

009:022 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye
        provoked the LORD to wrath.

009:023 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go
        up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye
        rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye
        believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.

009:024 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I
        knew you.

009:025 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights,
        as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he
        would destroy you.

009:026 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD,
        destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast
        redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth
        out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

009:027 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not
        unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness,
        nor to their sin:

009:028 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the
        LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he
        promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them
        out to slay them in the wilderness.

009:029 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou
        broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out
        arm.

010:001 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of
        stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount,
        and make thee an ark of wood.

010:002 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the
        first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in
        the ark.

010:003 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of
        stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having
        the two tables in mine hand.

010:004 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
        the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the
        mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly:
        and the LORD gave them unto me.

010:005 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the
        tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the
        LORD commanded me.

010:006 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of
        the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there
        he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's
        office in his stead.

010:007 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to
        Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

010:008 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the
        ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to
        minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

010:009 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;
        the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God
        promised him.

010:010 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty
        days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that
        time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.

010:011 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the
        people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I
        sware unto their fathers to give unto them.

010:012 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee,
        but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to
        love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and
        with all thy soul,

010:013 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which
        I command thee this day for thy good?

010:014 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy
        God, the earth also, with all that therein is.

010:015 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and
        he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as
        it is this day.

010:016 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no
        more stiffnecked.

010:017 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a
        great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not
        persons, nor taketh reward:

010:018 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and
        loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

010:019 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the
        land of Egypt.

010:020 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to
        him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.

010:021 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee
        these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

010:022 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten
        persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars
        of heaven for multitude.

011:001 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his
        charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his
        commandments, alway.

011:002 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which
        have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of
        the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his
        stretched out arm,

011:003 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of
        Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

011:004 And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and
        to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to
        overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath
        destroyed them unto this day;

011:005 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into
        this place;

011:006 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the
        son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed
        them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the
        substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all
        Israel:

011:007 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which
        he did.

011:008 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command
        you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the
        land, whither ye go to possess it;

011:009 And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD
        sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a
        land that floweth with milk and honey.

011:010 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as
        the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst
        thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of
        herbs:

011:011 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills
        and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:

011:012 A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD
        thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year
        even unto the end of the year.

011:013 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto
        my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD
        your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all
        your soul,

011:014 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,
        the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in
        thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.

011:015 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou
        mayest eat and be full.

011:016 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and
        ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

011:017 And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut
        up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield
        not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good
        land which the LORD giveth you.

011:018 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in
        your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they
        may be as frontlets between your eyes.

011:019 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when
        thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way,
        when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

011:020 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,
        and upon thy gates:

011:021 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your
        children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers
        to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

011:022 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I
        command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in
        all his ways, and to cleave unto him;

011:023 Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before
        you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than
        yourselves.

011:024 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall
        be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the
        river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast
        be.

011:025 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD
        your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon
        all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto
        you.

011:026 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

011:027 A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God,
        which I command you this day:

011:028 And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD
        your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you
        this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.

011:029 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought
        thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that
        thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse
        upon mount Ebal.

011:030 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the
        sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in
        the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

011:031 For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land
        which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it,
        and dwell therein.

011:032 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments
        which I set before you this day.

012:001 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe
        to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth
        thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.

012:002 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations
        which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high
        mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:

012:003 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars,
        and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the
        graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out
        of that place.

012:004 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.

012:005 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of
        all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his
        habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:

012:006 And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your
        sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand,
        and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings
        of your herds and of your flocks:

012:007 And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall
        rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your
        households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.

012:008 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,
        every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.

012:009 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
        which the LORD your God giveth you.

012:010 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the
        LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you
        rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in
        safety;

012:011 Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall
        choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye
        bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your
        sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand,
        and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:

012:012 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your
        sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your
        maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates;
        forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.

012:013 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings
        in every place that thou seest:

012:014 But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy
        tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there
        thou shalt do all that I command thee.

012:015 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy
        gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the
        blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the
        unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and
        as of the hart.

012:016 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the
        earth as water.

012:017 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or
        of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or
        of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy
        freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:

012:018 But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place
        which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and
        thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
        Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before
        the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.

012:019 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long
        as thou livest upon the earth.

012:020 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath
        promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because
        thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh,
        whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

012:021 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his
        name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy
        herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I
        have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates
        whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

012:022 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat
        them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.

012:023 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the
        life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.

012:024 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as
        water.

012:025 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with
        thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is
        right in the sight of the LORD.

012:026 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt
        take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:

012:027 And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the
        blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of
        thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD
        thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.

012:028 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it
        may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for
        ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the
        sight of the LORD thy God.

012:029 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before
        thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest
        them, and dwellest in their land;

012:030 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following
        them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that
        thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these
        nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.

012:031 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every
        abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto
        their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have
        burnt in the fire to their gods.

012:032 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt
        not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

013:001 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,
        and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,

013:002 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto
        thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not
        known, and let us serve them;

013:003 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that
        dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know
        whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with
        all your soul.

013:004 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep
        his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him,
        and cleave unto him.

013:005 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to
        death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD
        your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and
        redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out
        of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in.
        So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.

013:006 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy
        daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as
        thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and
        serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy
        fathers;

013:007 Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you,
        nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the
        earth even unto the other end of the earth;

013:008 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither
        shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither
        shalt thou conceal him:

013:009 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon
        him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the
        people.

013:010 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he
        hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which
        brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
        bondage.

013:011 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any
        such wickedness as this is among you.

013:012 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD
        thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,

013:013 Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among
        you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying,
        Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;

013:014 Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently;
        and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such
        abomination is wrought among you;

013:015 Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the
        edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is
        therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.

013:016 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of
        the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all
        the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it
        shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.

013:017 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine
        hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger,
        and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and
        multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;

013:018 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to
        keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do
        that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.

014:001 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut
        yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the
        dead.

014:002 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the
        LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself,
        above all the nations that are upon the earth.

014:003 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.

014:004 These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep,
        and the goat,

014:005 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild
        goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.

014:006 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft
        into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye
        shall eat.

014:007 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud,
        or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the
        hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the
        hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.

014:008 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not
        the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their
        flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.

014:009 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that
        have fins and scales shall ye eat:

014:010 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is
        unclean unto you.

014:011 Of all clean birds ye shall eat.

014:012 But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and
        the ossifrage, and the ospray,

014:013 And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,

014:014 And every raven after his kind,

014:015 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk
        after his kind,

014:016 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,

014:017 And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,

014:018 And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing,
        and the bat.

014:019 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they
        shall not be eaten.

014:020 But of all clean fowls ye may eat.

014:021 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt
        give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may
        eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an
        holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid
        in his mother's milk.

014:022 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the
        field bringeth forth year by year.

014:023 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which
        he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy
        corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy
        herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the
        LORD thy God always.

014:024 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able
        to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the
        LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD
        thy God hath blessed thee:

014:025 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in
        thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God
        shall choose:

014:026 And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul
        lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for
        strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou
        shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt
        rejoice, thou, and thine household,

014:027 And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not
        forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.

014:028 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe
        of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within
        thy gates:

014:029 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with
        thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow,
        which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be
        satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the
        work of thine hand which thou doest.

015:001 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.

015:002 And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that
        lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall
        not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it
        is called the LORD's release.

015:003 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is
        thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;

015:004 Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall
        greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee for an inheritance to possess it:

015:005 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy
        God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command
        thee this day.

015:006 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and
        thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow;
        and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not
        reign over thee.

015:007 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within
        any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand
        from thy poor brother:

015:008 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely
        lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.

015:009 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,
        saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and
        thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest
        him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be
        sin unto thee.

015:010 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be
        grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing
        the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all
        that thou puttest thine hand unto.

015:011 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I
        command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy
        brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.

015:012 And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold
        unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year
        thou shalt let him go free from thee.

015:013 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not
        let him go away empty:

015:014 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of
        thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the
        LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.

015:015 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
        of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I
        command thee this thing to day.

015:016 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from
        thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is
        well with thee;

015:017 Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear
        unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also
        unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.

015:018 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away
        free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant
        to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall
        bless thee in all that thou doest.

015:019 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock
        thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no
        work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the
        firstling of thy sheep.

015:020 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the
        place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.

015:021 And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or
        blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it
        unto the LORD thy God.

015:022 Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean
        person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.

015:023 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it
        upon the ground as water.

016:001 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD
        thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought
        thee forth out of Egypt by night.

016:002 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy
        God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD
        shall choose to place his name there.

016:003 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt
        thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of
        affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in
        haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest
        forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.

016:004 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy
        coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh,
        which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all
        night until the morning.

016:005 Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy
        gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:

016:006 But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place
        his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even,
        at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest
        forth out of Egypt.

016:007 And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD
        thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and
        go unto thy tents.

016:008 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh
        day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt
        do no work therein.

016:009 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the
        seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle
        to the corn.

016:010 And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God
        with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which
        thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD
        thy God hath blessed thee:

016:011 And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy
        son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy
        maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the
        stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among
        you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place
        his name there.

016:012 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and
        thou shalt observe and do these statutes.

016:013 Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after
        that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:

016:014 And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and
        thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
        Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that
        are within thy gates.

016:015 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy
        God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD
        thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the
        works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

016:016 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the
        LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast
        of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the
        feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the
        LORD empty:

016:017 Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing
        of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.

016:018 Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates,
        which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and
        they shall judge the people with just judgment.

016:019 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons,
        neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the
        wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.

016:020 That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou
        mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God
        giveth thee.

016:021 Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the
        altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.

016:022 Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy
        God hateth.

017:001 Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or
        sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that
        is an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

017:002 If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the
        LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought
        wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing
        his covenant,

017:003 And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them,
        either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I
        have not commanded;

017:004 And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired
        diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain,
        that such abomination is wrought in Israel:

017:005 Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have
        committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or
        that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.

017:006 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he
        that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of
        one witness he shall not be put to death.

017:007 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him
        to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou
        shalt put the evil away from among you.

017:008 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between
        blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and
        stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then
        shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the
        LORD thy God shall choose;

017:009 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the
        judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall
        shew thee the sentence of judgment:

017:010 And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of
        that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and
        thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform
        thee:

017:011 According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach
        thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell
        thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence
        which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the
        left.

017:012 And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken
        unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the
        LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and
        thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.

017:013 And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more
        presumptuously.

017:014 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt
        say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that
        are about me;

017:015 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD
        thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou
        set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee,
        which is not thy brother.

017:016 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the
        people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply
        horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall
        henceforth return no more that way.

017:017 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart
        turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself
        silver and gold.

017:018 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his
        kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book
        out of that which is before the priests the Levites:

017:019 And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the
        days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God,
        to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do
        them:

017:020 That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that
        he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or
        to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his
        kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.

018:001 The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have
        no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the
        offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.

018:002 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren:
        the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.

018:003 And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them
        that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they
        shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks,
        and the maw.

018:004 The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine
        oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give
        him.

018:005 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to
        stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons
        for ever.

018:006 And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel,
        where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind
        unto the place which the LORD shall choose;

018:007 Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all
        his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the
        LORD.

018:008 They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh
        of the sale of his patrimony.

018:009 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of
        those nations.

018:010 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son
        or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth
        divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a
        witch.

018:011 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a
        wizard, or a necromancer.

018:012 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD:
        and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive
        them out from before thee.

018:013 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.

018:014 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto
        observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the
        LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.

018:015 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the
        midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye
        shall hearken;

018:016 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in
        Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear
        again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this
        great fire any more, that I die not.

018:017 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which
        they have spoken.

018:018 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like
        unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall
        speak unto them all that I shall command him.

018:019 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken
        unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require
        it of him.

018:020 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my
        name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall
        speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.

018:021 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word
        which the LORD hath not spoken?

018:022 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing
        follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD
        hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it
        presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

019:001 When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the
        LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and
        dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;

019:002 Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy
        land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.

019:003 Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy
        land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into
        three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.

019:004 And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither,
        that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom
        he hated not in time past;

019:005 As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew
        wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down
        the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth
        upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of
        those cities, and live:

019:006 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his
        heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and
        slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he
        hated him not in time past.

019:007 Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three
        cities for thee.

019:008 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn
        unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised
        to give unto thy fathers;

019:009 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I
        command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk
        ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for
        thee, beside these three:

019:010 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD
        thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon
        thee.

019:011 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him,
        and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die,
        and fleeth into one of these cities:

019:012 Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence,
        and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he
        may die.

019:013 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the
        guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with
        thee.

019:014 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of
        old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt
        inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to
        possess it.

019:015 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity,
        or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of
        two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the
        matter be established.

019:016 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against
        him that which is wrong;

019:017 Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall
        stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges,
        which shall be in those days;

019:018 And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold,
        if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely
        against his brother;

019:019 Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto
        his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.

019:020 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall
        henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.

019:021 And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye
        for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

020:001 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest
        horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not
        afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which
        brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

020:002 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that
        the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,

020:003 And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day
        unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint,
        fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because
        of them;

020:004 For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for
        you against your enemies, to save you.

020:005 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man
        is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated
        it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the
        battle, and another man dedicate it.

020:006 And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not
        yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house,
        lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.

020:007 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not
        taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die
        in the battle, and another man take her.

020:008 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they
        shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted?
        let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's
        heart faint as well as his heart.

020:009 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of
        speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the
        armies to lead the people.

020:010 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then
        proclaim peace unto it.

020:011 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open
        unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found
        therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve
        thee.

020:012 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war
        against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:

020:013 And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands,
        thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the
        sword:

020:014 But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all
        that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou
        take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine
        enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

020:015 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off
        from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.

020:016 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth
        give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing
        that breatheth:

020:017 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and
        the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites,
        and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:

020:018 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,
        which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against
        the LORD your God.

020:019 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war
        against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees
        thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of
        them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the
        field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:

020:020 Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for
        meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt
        build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee,
        until it be subdued.

021:001 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God
        giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not
        known who hath slain him:

021:002 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they
        shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that
        is slain:

021:003 And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain
        man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which
        hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the
        yoke;

021:004 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a
        rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall
        strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:

021:005 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the
        LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in
        the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every
        controversy and every stroke be tried:

021:006 And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain
        man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded
        in the valley:

021:007 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this
        blood, neither have our eyes seen it.

021:008 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast
        redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of
        Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.

021:009 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among
        you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of
        the LORD.

021:010 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the
        LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou
        hast taken them captive,

021:011 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a
        desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;

021:012 Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall
        shave her head, and pare her nails;

021:013 And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her,
        and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her
        mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her,
        and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.

021:014 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou
        shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her
        at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her,
        because thou hast humbled her.

021:015 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and
        they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated;
        and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:

021:016 Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that
        which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved
        firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the
        firstborn:

021:017 But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the
        firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath:
        for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the
        firstborn is his.

021:018 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not
        obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and
        that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto
        them:

021:019 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and
        bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate
        of his place;

021:020 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son
        is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is
        a glutton, and a drunkard.

021:021 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that
        he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all
        Israel shall hear, and fear.

021:022 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be
        to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:

021:023 His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou
        shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is
        accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD
        thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

022:001 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray,
        and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them
        again unto thy brother.

022:002 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him
        not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it
        shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou
        shalt restore it to him again.

022:003 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou
        do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's,
        which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do
        likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.

022:004 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by
        the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help
        him to lift them up again.

022:005 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,
        neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do
        so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

022:006 If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any
        tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs,
        and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou
        shalt not take the dam with the young:

022:007 But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young
        to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest
        prolong thy days.

022:008 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a
        battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine
        house, if any man fall from thence.

022:009 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the
        fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy
        vineyard, be defiled.

022:010 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

022:011 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen
        and linen together.

022:012 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy
        vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.

022:013 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,

022:014 And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil
        name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to
        her, I found her not a maid:

022:015 Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and
        bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the
        elders of the city in the gate:

022:016 And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my
        daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;

022:017 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her,
        saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the
        tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the
        cloth before the elders of the city.

022:018 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise
        him;

022:019 And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and
        give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath
        brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall
        be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.

022:020 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not
        found for the damsel:

022:021 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her
        father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with
        stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel,
        to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put
        evil away from among you.

022:022 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband,
        then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with
        the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from
        Israel.

022:023 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and
        a man find her in the city, and lie with her;

022:024 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city,
        and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel,
        because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because
        he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away
        evil from among you.

022:025 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man
        force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with
        her shall die.

022:026 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the
        damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth
        against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this
        matter:

022:027 For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried,
        and there was none to save her.

022:028 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not
        betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be
        found;

022:029 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's
        father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife;
        because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his
        days.

022:030 A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his
        father's skirt.

023:001 He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut
        off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

023:002 A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD;
        even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the
        congregation of the LORD.

023:003 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation
        of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not
        enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:

023:004 Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way,
        when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired
        against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia,
        to curse thee.

023:005 Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam;
        but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto
        thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.

023:006 Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy
        days for ever.

023:007 Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou
        shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in
        his land.

023:008 The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the
        congregation of the LORD in their third generation.

023:009 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep
        thee from every wicked thing.

023:010 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of
        uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go
        abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

023:011 But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself
        with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the
        camp again.

023:012 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou
        shalt go forth abroad:

023:013 And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be,
        when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith,
        and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:

023:014 For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to
        deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee;
        therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing
        in thee, and turn away from thee.

023:015 Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is
        escaped from his master unto thee:

023:016 He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which
        he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best:
        thou shalt not oppress him.

023:017 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a
        sodomite of the sons of Israel.

023:018 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a
        dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even
        both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

023:019 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money,
        usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:

023:020 Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy
        brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God
        may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the
        land whither thou goest to possess it.

023:021 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt
        not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require
        it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.

023:022 But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.

023:023 That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and
        perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast
        vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy
        mouth.

023:024 When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou
        mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou
        shalt not put any in thy vessel.

023:025 When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then
        thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not
        move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.

024:001 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to
        pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath
        found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill
        of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of
        his house.

024:002 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be
        another man's wife.

024:003 And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of
        divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of
        his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be
        his wife;

024:004 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her
        again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is
        abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land
        to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

024:005 When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war,
        neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be
        free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he
        hath taken.

024:006 No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge:
        for he taketh a man's life to pledge.

024:007 If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children
        of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then
        that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among
        you.

024:008 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe
        diligently, and do according to all that the priests the
        Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall
        observe to do.

024:009 Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way,
        after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.

024:010 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go
        into his house to fetch his pledge.

024:011 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend
        shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.

024:012 And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:

024:013 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the
        sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and
        bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the
        LORD thy God.

024:014 Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and
        needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that
        are in thy land within thy gates:

024:015 At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun
        go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon
        it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto
        thee.

024:016 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
        neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:
        every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

024:017 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of
        the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:

024:018 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and
        the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command
        thee to do this thing.

024:019 When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast
        forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch
        it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for
        the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the
        work of thine hands.

024:020 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the
        boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the
        fatherless, and for the widow.

024:021 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not
        glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the
        fatherless, and for the widow.

024:022 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
        of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

025:001 If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto
        judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall
        justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.

025:002 And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten,
        that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten
        before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.

025:003 Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he
        should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes,
        then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.

025:004 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.

025:005 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no
        child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a
        stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take
        her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's
        brother unto her.

025:006 And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall
        succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his
        name be not put out of Israel.

025:007 And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let
        his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say,
        My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a
        name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's
        brother.

025:008 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto
        him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;

025:009 Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of
        the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in
        his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto
        that man that will not build up his brother's house.

025:010 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that
        hath his shoe loosed.

025:011 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the
        one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of
        him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh
        him by the secrets:

025:012 Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity
        her.

025:013 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a
        small.

025:014 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great
        and a small.

025:015 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and
        just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened
        in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

025:016 For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously,
        are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

025:017 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were
        come forth out of Egypt;

025:018 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee,
        even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint
        and weary; and he feared not God.

025:019 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee
        rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the
        LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it,
        that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under
        heaven; thou shalt not forget it.

026:001 And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the
        LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest
        it, and dwellest therein;

026:002 That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the
        earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy
        God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go
        unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place
        his name there.

026:003 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days,
        and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God,
        that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our
        fathers for to give us.

026:004 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and
        set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.

026:005 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian
        ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt,
        and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation,
        great, mighty, and populous:

026:006 And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and
        laid upon us hard bondage:

026:007 And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD
        heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour,
        and our oppression:

026:008 And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand,
        and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and
        with signs, and with wonders:

026:009 And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this
        land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.

026:010 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land,
        which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it
        before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:

026:011 And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy
        God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the
        Levite, and the stranger that is among you.

026:012 When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine
        increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and
        hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless,
        and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be
        filled;

026:013 Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought
        away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have
        given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the
        fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy
        commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not
        transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.

026:014 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken
        away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought
        thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the
        LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast
        commanded me.

026:015 Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy
        people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou
        swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and
        honey.

026:016 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these
        statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them
        with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

026:017 Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to
        walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his
        commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his
        voice:

026:018 And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar
        people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep
        all his commandments;

026:019 And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in
        praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an
        holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.

027:001 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people,
        saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this
        day.

027:002 And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto
        the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt
        set thee up great stones, and plaister them with plaister:

027:003 And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when
        thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land
        which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with
        milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised
        thee.

027:004 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye
        shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in
        mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister.

027:005 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an
        altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon
        them.

027:006 Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole
        stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the
        LORD thy God:

027:007 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and
        rejoice before the LORD thy God.

027:008 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law
        very plainly.

027:009 And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel,
        saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art
        become the people of the LORD thy God.

027:010 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and
        do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee
        this day.

027:011 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,

027:012 These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when
        ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and
        Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:

027:013 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad,
        and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

027:014 And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of
        Israel with a loud voice,

027:015 Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an
        abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the
        craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the
        people shall answer and say, Amen.

027:016 Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother.
        And all the people shall say, Amen.

027:017 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all
        the people shall say, Amen.

027:018 Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way.
        And all the people shall say, Amen.

027:019 Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger,
        fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.

027:020 Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he
        uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say,
        Amen.

027:021 Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the
        people shall say, Amen.

027:022 Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his
        father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people
        shall say, Amen.

027:023 Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the
        people shall say, Amen.

027:024 Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the
        people shall say, Amen.

027:025 Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person.
        And all the people shall say, Amen.

027:026 Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to
        do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.

028:001 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently
        unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all
        his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD
        thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:

028:002 And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee,
        if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.

028:003 Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be
        in the field.

028:004 Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
        ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine,
        and the flocks of thy sheep.

028:005 Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

028:006 Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt
        thou be when thou goest out.

028:007 The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee
        to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against
        thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways.

028:008 The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy
        storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and
        he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee.

028:009 The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as
        he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments
        of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways.

028:010 And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by
        the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.

028:011 And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit
        of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit
        of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy
        fathers to give thee.

028:012 The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to
        give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all
        the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations,
        and thou shalt not borrow.

028:013 And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and
        thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if
        that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God,
        which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:

028:014 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I
        command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to
        go after other gods to serve them.

028:015 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the
        voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his
        commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day;
        that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:

028:016 Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in
        the field.

028:017 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.

028:018 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
        land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

028:019 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt
        thou be when thou goest out.

028:020 The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke,
        in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou
        be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the
        wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.

028:021 The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he
        have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to
        possess it.

028:022 The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a
        fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning,
        and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and
        they shall pursue thee until thou perish.

028:023 And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the
        earth that is under thee shall be iron.

028:024 The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from
        heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

028:025 The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies:
        thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways
        before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the
        earth.

028:026 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and
        unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.

028:027 The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the
        emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou
        canst not be healed.

028:028 The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and
        astonishment of heart:

028:029 And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in
        darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou
        shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall
        save thee.

028:030 Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her:
        thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein:
        thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes
        thereof.

028:031 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not
        eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from
        before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep
        shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to
        rescue them.

028:032 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people,
        and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all
        the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand.

028:033 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation
        which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only
        oppressed and crushed alway:

028:034 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which
        thou shalt see.

028:035 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with
        a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot
        unto the top of thy head.

028:036 The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set
        over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers
        have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and
        stone.

028:037 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a
        byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.

028:038 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt
        gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.

028:039 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither
        drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall
        eat them.

028:040 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but
        thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive
        shall cast his fruit.

028:041 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy
        them; for they shall go into captivity.

028:042 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.

028:043 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very
        high; and thou shalt come down very low.

028:044 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he
        shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.

028:045 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall
        pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed;
        because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy
        God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he
        commanded thee:

028:046 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and
        upon thy seed for ever.

028:047 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness,
        and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;

028:048 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall
        send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,
        and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron
        upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.

028:049 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the
        end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose
        tongue thou shalt not understand;

028:050 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the
        person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:

028:051 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy
        land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee
        either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or
        flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.

028:052 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and
        fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all
        thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates
        throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given
        thee.

028:053 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of
        thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath
        given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith
        thine enemies shall distress thee:

028:054 So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate,
        his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife
        of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he
        shall leave:

028:055 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his
        children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him
        in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies
        shall distress thee in all thy gates.

028:056 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not
        adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for
        delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the
        husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her
        daughter,

028:057 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her
        feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she
        shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege
        and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in
        thy gates.

028:058 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that
        are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious
        and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;

028:059 Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues
        of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and
        sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.

028:060 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,
        which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

028:061 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in
        the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee,
        until thou be destroyed.

028:062 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the
        stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey
        the voice of the LORD thy God.

028:063 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you
        to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice
        over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye
        shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to
        possess it.

028:064 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one
        end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt
        serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have
        known, even wood and stone.

028:065 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall
        the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee
        there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of
        mind:

028:066 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt
        fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:

028:067 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at
        even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear
        of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of
        thine eyes which thou shalt see.

028:068 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by
        the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more
        again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for
        bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

029:001 These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded
        Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab,
        beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.

029:002 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have
        seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of
        Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all
        his land;

029:003 The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs,
        and those great miracles:

029:004 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes
        to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

029:005 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes
        are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon
        thy foot.

029:006 Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong
        drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.

029:007 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon,
        and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle,
        and we smote them:

029:008 And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto
        the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of
        Manasseh.

029:009 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that
        ye may prosper in all that ye do.

029:010 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your
        captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with
        all the men of Israel,

029:011 Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy
        camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:

029:012 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God,
        and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee
        this day:

029:013 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself,
        and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee,
        and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,
        and to Jacob.

029:014 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;

029:015 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the
        LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this
        day:

029:016 (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how
        we came through the nations which ye passed by;

029:017 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and
        stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)

029:018 Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or
        tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our
        God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there
        should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;

029:019 And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse,
        that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have
        peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add
        drunkenness to thirst:

029:020 The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD
        and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the
        curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and
        the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.

029:021 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the
        tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant
        that are written in this book of the law:

029:022 So that the generation to come of your children that shall
        rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far
        land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and
        the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;

029:023 And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and
        burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass
        groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah,
        Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and
        in his wrath:

029:024 Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus
        unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?

029:025 Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of
        the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he
        brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:

029:026 For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods
        whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:

029:027 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to
        bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:

029:028 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in
        wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another
        land, as it is this day.

029:029 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those
        things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children
        for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

030:001 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon
        thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before
        thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations,
        whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,

030:002 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his
        voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and
        thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;

030:003 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have
        compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all
        the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.

030:004 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of
        heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and
        from thence will he fetch thee:

030:005 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy
        fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do
        thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.

030:006 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the
        heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine
        heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.

030:007 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine
        enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.

030:008 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do
        all his commandments which I command thee this day.

030:009 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of
        thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy
        cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD
        will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy
        fathers:

030:010 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to
        keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in
        this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God
        with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

030:011 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not
        hidden from thee, neither is it far off.

030:012 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up
        for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it,
        and do it?

030:013 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
        shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we
        may hear it, and do it?

030:014 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy
        heart, that thou mayest do it.

030:015 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
        and evil;

030:016 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to
        walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his
        statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and
        multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land
        whither thou goest to possess it.

030:017 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but
        shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

030:018 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and
        that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither
        thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.

030:019 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I
        have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing:
        therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:

030:020 That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest
        obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he
        is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest
        dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to
        Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

031:001 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

031:002 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old
        this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath
        said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

031:003 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will
        destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess
        them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD
        hath said.

031:004 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,
        kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he
        destroyed.

031:005 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may
        do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have
        commanded you.

031:006 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of
        them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee;
        he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

031:007 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight
        of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must
        go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn
        unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to
        inherit it.

031:008 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be
        with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear
        not, neither be dismayed.

031:009 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests
        the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.

031:010 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven
        years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast
        of tabernacles,

031:011 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in
        the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law
        before all Israel in their hearing.

031:012 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and
        thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and
        that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe
        to do all the words of this law:

031:013 And that their children, which have not known any thing, may
        hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live
        in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

031:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that
        thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the
        tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge.
        And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the
        tabernacle of the congregation.

031:015 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a
        cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the
        tabernacle.

031:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with
        thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring
        after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go
        to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant
        which I have made with them.

031:017 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I
        will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they
        shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall
        them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils
        come upon us, because our God is not among us?

031:018 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils
        which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto
        other gods.

031:019 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the
        children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may
        be a witness for me against the children of Israel.

031:020 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
        unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they
        shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then
        will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke
        me, and break my covenant.

031:021 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
        befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a
        witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of
        their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about,
        even now, before I have brought them into the land which I
        sware.

031:022 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it
        the children of Israel.

031:023 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be
        strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the
        children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and
        I will be with thee.

031:024 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the
        words of this law in a book, until they were finished,

031:025 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the
        covenant of the LORD, saying,

031:026 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark
        of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for
        a witness against thee.

031:027 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I
        am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious
        against the LORD; and how much more after my death?

031:028 Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your
        officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call
        heaven and earth to record against them.

031:029 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt
        yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded
        you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye
        will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger
        through the work of your hands.

031:030 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel
        the words of this song, until they were ended.

032:001 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth,
        the words of my mouth.

032:002 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as
        the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the
        showers upon the grass:

032:003 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye
        greatness unto our God.

032:004 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are
        judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right
        is he.

032:005 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of
        his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.

032:006 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is
        not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made
        thee, and established thee?

032:007 Remember the days of old, consider the years of many
        generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy
        elders, and they will tell thee.

032:008 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,
        when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the
        people according to the number of the children of Israel.

032:009 For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
        inheritance.

032:010 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
        wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him
        as the apple of his eye.

032:011 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
        spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her
        wings:

032:012 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god
        with him.

032:013 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he
        might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck
        honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

032:014 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams
        of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of
        wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

032:015 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou
        art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he
        forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of
        his salvation.

032:016 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with
        abominations provoked they him to anger.

032:017 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they
        knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers
        feared not.

032:018 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
        forgotten God that formed thee.

032:019 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the
        provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.

032:020 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what
        their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation,
        children in whom is no faith.

032:021 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God;
        they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will
        move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I
        will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.

032:022 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
        lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase,
        and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.

032:023 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon
        them.

032:024 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning
        heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth
        of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

032:025 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the
        young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of
        gray hairs.

032:026 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
        remembrance of them to cease from among men:

032:027 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
        adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they
        should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all
        this.

032:028 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
        understanding in them.

032:029 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
        would consider their latter end!

032:030 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to
        flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut
        them up?

032:031 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
        being judges.

032:032 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
        Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are
        bitter:

032:033 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
        asps.

032:034 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
        treasures?

032:035 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall
        slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand,
        and the things that shall come upon them make haste.

032:036 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for
        his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and
        there is none shut up, or left.

032:037 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom
        they trusted,

032:038 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine
        of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and
        be your protection.

032:039 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I
        kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there
        any that can deliver out of my hand.

032:040 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

032:041 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on
        judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will
        reward them that hate me.

032:042 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
        devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the
        captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

032:043 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the
        blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his
        adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his
        people.

032:044 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the
        ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

032:045 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all
        Israel:

032:046 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words
        which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command
        your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.

032:047 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life:
        and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land,
        whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

032:048 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,

032:049 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which
        is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and
        behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of
        Israel for a possession:

032:050 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered
        unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and
        was gathered unto his people:

032:051 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel
        at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin;
        because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of
        Israel.

032:052 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
        thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

033:001 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God
        blessed the children of Israel before his death.

033:002 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir
        unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with
        ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law
        for them.

033:003 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and
        they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy
        words.

033:004 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the
        congregation of Jacob.

033:005 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and
        the tribes of Israel were gathered together.

033:006 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.

033:007 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD,
        the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his
        hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from
        his enemies.

033:008 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy
        holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou
        didst strive at the waters of Meribah;

033:009 Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen
        him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own
        children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy
        covenant.

033:010 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they
        shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon
        thine altar.

033:011 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;
        smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of
        them that hate him, that they rise not again.

033:012 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell
        in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day
        long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.

033:013 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for
        the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep
        that coucheth beneath,

033:014 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for
        the precious things put forth by the moon,

033:015 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the
        precious things of the lasting hills,

033:016 And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof,
        and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the
        blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the
        head of him that was separated from his brethren.

033:017 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns
        are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the
        people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten
        thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

033:018 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;
        and, Issachar, in thy tents.

033:019 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall
        offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the
        abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

033:020 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he
        dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the
        head.

033:021 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in
        a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the
        heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and
        his judgments with Israel.

033:022 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from
        Bashan.

033:023 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour,
        and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west
        and the south.

033:024 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let
        him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in
        oil.

033:025 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall
        thy strength be.

033:026 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon
        the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

033:027 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
        everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from
        before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.

033:028 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob
        shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall
        drop down dew.

033:029 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people
        saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the
        sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found
        liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.

034:001 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of
        Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And
        the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,

034:002 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and
        all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,

034:003 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the
        city of palm trees, unto Zoar.

034:004 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware
        unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give
        it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine
        eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.

034:005 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of
        Moab, according to the word of the LORD.

034:006 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over
        against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto
        this day.

034:007 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died:
        his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

034:008 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of
        Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for
        Moses were ended.

034:009 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
        for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of
        Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

034:010 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,
        whom the LORD knew face to face,

034:011 In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to
        do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
        and to all his land,

034:012 And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which
        Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.

Book 06	Joshua

001:001 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came
        to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun,
        Moses' minister, saying,

001:002 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this
        Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do
        give to them, even to the children of Israel.

001:003 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that
        have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.

001:004 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great
        river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and
        unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be
        your coast.

001:005 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the
        days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee:
        I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

001:006 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt
        thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto
        their fathers to give them.

001:007 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest
        observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant
        commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the
        left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest.

001:008 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but
        thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest
        observe to do according to all that is written therein: for
        then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt
        have good success.

001:009 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be
        not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is
        with thee whithersoever thou goest.

001:010 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

001:011 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare
        you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this
        Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God
        giveth you to possess it.

001:012 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the
        tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,

001:013 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD
        commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest,
        and hath given you this land.

001:014 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in
        the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye
        shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of
        valour, and help them;

001:015 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given
        you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your
        God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your
        possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave
        you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

001:016 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us
        we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.

001:017 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
        hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he
        was with Moses.

001:018 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and
        will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest
        him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good
        courage.

002:001 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
        secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they
        went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged
        there.

002:002 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there
        came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to
        search out the country.

002:003 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth
        the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine
        house: for they be come to search out all the country.

002:004 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus,
        There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:

002:005 And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate,
        when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went
        I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake
        them.

002:006 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid
        them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon
        the roof.

002:007 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the
        fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone
        out, they shut the gate.

002:008 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the
        roof;

002:009 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you
        the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all
        the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.

002:010 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red
        sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto
        the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side
        Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.

002:011 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
        neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because
        of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and
        in earth beneath.

002:012 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I
        have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto
        my father's house, and give me a true token:

002:013 And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my
        brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver
        our lives from death.

002:014 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not
        this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given
        us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.

002:015 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her
        house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

002:016 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
        pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until
        the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.

002:017 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine
        oath which thou hast made us swear.

002:018 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line
        of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down
        by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy
        brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.

002:019 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of
        thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head,
        and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in
        the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon
        him.

002:020 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of
        thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.

002:021 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she
        sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet
        line in the window.

002:022 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there
        three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers
        sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.

002:023 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
        passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him
        all things that befell them:

002:024 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into
        our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the
        country do faint because of us.

003:001 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
        Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of
        Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.

003:002 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
        through the host;

003:003 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of
        the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites
        bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after
        it.

003:004 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two
        thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may
        know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this
        way heretofore.

003:005 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to
        morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.

003:006 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of
        the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took
        up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.

003:007 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to
        magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know
        that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.

003:008 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
        covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water
        of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.

003:009 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and
        hear the words of the LORD your God.

003:010 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is
        among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before
        you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the
        Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the
        Jebusites.

003:011 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth
        passeth over before you into Jordan.

003:012 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
        out of every tribe a man.

003:013 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of
        the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the
        earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of
        Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from
        above; and they shall stand upon an heap.

003:014 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents,
        to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the
        covenant before the people;

003:015 And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the
        feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim
        of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the
        time of harvest,)

003:016 That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up
        upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside
        Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,
        even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people
        passed over right against Jericho.

003:017 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the
        Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people
        were passed clean over Jordan.

004:001 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
        over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

004:002 Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a
        man,

004:003 And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst
        of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood
        firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you,
        and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this
        night.

004:004 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
        children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:

004:005 And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the
        LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every
        man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the
        number of the tribes of the children of Israel:

004:006 That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask
        their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these
        stones?

004:007 Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut
        off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed
        over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these
        stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for
        ever.

004:008 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and
        took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD
        spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of
        the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto
        the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.

004:009 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the
        place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the
        covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.

004:010 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of
        Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded
        Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses
        commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.

004:011 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
        over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests,
        in the presence of the people.

004:012 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half
        the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children
        of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:

004:013 About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the
        LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

004:014 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all
        Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the
        days of his life.

004:015 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

004:016 Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that
        they come up out of Jordan.

004:017 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out
        of Jordan.

004:018 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
        covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan,
        and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry
        land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and
        flowed over all his banks, as they did before.

004:019 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the
        first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of
        Jericho.

004:020 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did
        Joshua pitch in Gilgal.

004:021 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your
        children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What
        mean these stones?

004:022 Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over
        this Jordan on dry land.

004:023 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from
        before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God
        did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we
        were gone over:

004:024 That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the
        LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God
        for ever.

005:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
        were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the
        Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had
        dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of
        Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted,
        neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the
        children of Israel.

005:002 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp
        knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second
        time.

005:003 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children
        of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

005:004 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the
        people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the
        men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came
        out of Egypt.

005:005 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the
        people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they
        came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.

005:006 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the
        wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which
        came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the
        voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not
        shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers
        that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and
        honey.

005:007 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them
        Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they
        had not circumcised them by the way.

005:008 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
        people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they
        were whole.

005:009 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
        reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the
        place is called Gilgal unto this day.

005:010 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
        passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the
        plains of Jericho.

005:011 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow
        after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the
        selfsame day.

005:012 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
        old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna
        any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan
        that year.

005:013 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he
        lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man
        over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua
        went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our
        adversaries?

005:014 And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I
        now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did
        worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his
        servant?

005:015 And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy
        shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is
        holy. And Joshua did so.

006:001 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
        Israel: none went out, and none came in.

006:002 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine
        hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of
        valour.

006:003 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
        about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.

006:004 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
        rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city
        seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

006:005 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast
        with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the
        trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and
        the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people
        shall ascend up every man straight before him.

006:006 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto
        them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests
        bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.

006:007 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city,
        and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.

006:008 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people,
        that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
        horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets:
        and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.

006:009 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
        trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests
        going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

006:010 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not
        shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any
        word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout;
        then shall ye shout.

006:011 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it
        once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

006:012 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up
        the ark of the LORD.

006:013 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before
        the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the
        trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward
        came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and
        blowing with the trumpets.

006:014 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
        into the camp: so they did six days.

006:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
        about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the
        same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the
        city seven times.

006:016 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew
        with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the
        LORD hath given you the city.

006:017 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are
        therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she
        and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the
        messengers that we sent.

006:018 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing,
        lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed
        thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.

006:019 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
        are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the
        treasury of the LORD.

006:020 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:
        and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the
        trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the
        wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,
        every man straight before him, and they took the city.

006:021 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man
        and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the
        edge of the sword.

006:022 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
        country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the
        woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.

006:023 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out
        Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and
        all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and
        left them without the camp of Israel.

006:024 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein:
        only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of
        iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.

006:025 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's
        household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel
        even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which
        Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

006:026 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the
        man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city
        Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn,
        and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.

006:027 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised
        throughout all the country.

007:001 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the
        accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi,
        the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed
        thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the
        children of Israel.

007:002 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside
        Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying,
        Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.

007:003 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all
        the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go
        up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour
        thither; for they are but few.

007:004 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand
        men: and they fled before the men of Ai.

007:005 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for
        they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and
        smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the
        people melted, and became as water.

007:006 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his
        face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the
        elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.

007:007 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all
        brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand
        of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been
        content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!

007:008 O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs
        before their enemies!

007:009 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall
        hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name
        from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?

007:010 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest
        thou thus upon thy face?

007:011 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my
        covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of
        the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also,
        and they have put it even among their own stuff.

007:012 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
        enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because
        they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more,
        except ye destroy the accursed from among you.

007:013 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against
        to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an
        accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not
        stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed
        thing from among you.

007:014 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
        tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh
        shall come according to the families thereof; and the family
        which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the
        household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.

007:015 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing
        shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he
        hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he
        hath wrought folly in Israel.

007:016 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by
        their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

007:017 And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of
        the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by
        man; and Zabdi was taken:

007:018 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of
        Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of
        Judah, was taken.

007:019 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory
        to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and
        tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.

007:020 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned
        against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:

007:021 When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and
        two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty
        shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and,
        behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and
        the silver under it.

007:022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,
        behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

007:023 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought
        them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and
        laid them out before the LORD.

007:024 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of
        Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold,
        and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses,
        and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they
        brought them unto the valley of Achor.

007:025 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall
        trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones,
        and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with
        stones.

007:026 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day.
        So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore
        the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto
        this day.

008:001 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou
        dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go
        up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and
        his people, and his city, and his land:

008:002 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto
        Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle
        thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an
        ambush for the city behind it.

008:003 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against
        Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour,
        and sent them away by night.

008:004 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
        against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from
        the city, but be ye all ready:

008:005 And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto
        the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out
        against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,

008:006 (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from
        the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the
        first: therefore we will flee before them.

008:007 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the
        city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.

008:008 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall
        set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD
        shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.

008:009 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in
        ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of
        Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.

008:010 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the
        people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the
        people to Ai.

008:011 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,
        went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched
        on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them
        and Ai.

008:012 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
        ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

008:013 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was
        on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west
        of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the
        valley.

008:014 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they
        hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out
        against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time
        appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were
        liers in ambush against him behind the city.

008:015 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
        them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

008:016 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to
        pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were
        drawn away from the city.

008:017 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not
        out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued
        after Israel.

008:018 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is
        in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And
        Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward
        the city.

008:019 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran
        as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered
        into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on
        fire.

008:020 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and,
        behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they
        had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that
        fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.

008:021 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken
        the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they
        turned again, and slew the men of Ai.

008:022 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they
        were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on
        that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them
        remain or escape.

008:023 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.

008:024 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying
        all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness
        wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the
        edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the
        Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the
        sword.

008:025 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and
        women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

008:026 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out
        the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants
        of Ai.

008:027 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a
        prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD
        which he commanded Joshua.

008:028 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a
        desolation unto this day.

008:029 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as
        soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should
        take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the
        entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great
        heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.

008:030 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in
        mount Ebal,

008:031 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of
        Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an
        altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any
        iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD,
        and sacrificed peace offerings.

008:032 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
        which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.

008:033 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their
        judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the
        priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them;
        half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over
        against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had
        commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.

008:034 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings
        and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of
        the law.

008:035 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
        read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the
        women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were
        conversant among them.

009:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this
        side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the
        coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and
        the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
        Jebusite, heard thereof;

009:002 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
        and with Israel, with one accord.

009:003 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
        unto Jericho and to Ai,

009:004 They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been
        ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine
        bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;

009:005 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments
        upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and
        mouldy.

009:006 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
        him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country:
        now therefore make ye a league with us.

009:007 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye
        dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?

009:008 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua
        said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?

009:009 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants
        are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have
        heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,

009:010 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that
        were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king
        of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.

009:011 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country
        spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey,
        and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants:
        therefore now make ye a league with us.

009:012 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses
        on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it
        is dry, and it is mouldy:

009:013 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and,
        behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are
        become old by reason of the very long journey.

009:014 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at
        the mouth of the LORD.

009:015 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them,
        to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware
        unto them.

009:016 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had
        made a league with them, that they heard that they were their
        neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.

009:017 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their
        cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and
        Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.

009:018 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes
        of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of
        Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.

009:019 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have
        sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we
        may not touch them.

009:020 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest
        wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto
        them.

009:021 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
        hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation;
        as the princes had promised them.

009:022 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
        Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from
        you; when ye dwell among us?

009:023 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be
        freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of
        water for the house of my God.

009:024 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
        told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his
        servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the
        inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were
        sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this
        thing.

009:025 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and
        right unto thee to do unto us, do.

009:026 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
        the children of Israel, that they slew them not.

009:027 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of
        water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD,
        even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

010:001 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had
        heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it;
        as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai
        and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace
        with Israel, and were among them;

010:002 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as
        one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai,
        and all the men thereof were mighty.

010:003 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king
        of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia
        king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

010:004 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it
        hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.

010:005 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of
        Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king
        of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together,
        and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before
        Gibeon, and made war against it.

010:006 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
        saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us
        quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the
        Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together
        against us.

010:007 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
        with him, and all the mighty men of valour.

010:008 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
        delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them
        stand before thee.

010:009 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from
        Gilgal all night.

010:010 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them
        with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the
        way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and
        unto Makkedah.

010:011 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were
        in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great
        stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they
        were more which died with hailstones than they whom the
        children of Israel slew with the sword.

010:012 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD
        delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and
        he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon
        Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.

010:013 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
        had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written
        in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of
        heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

010:014 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
        LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought
        for Israel.

010:015 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
        Gilgal.

010:016 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
        Makkedah.

010:017 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid
        in a cave at Makkedah.

010:018 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
        and set men by it for to keep them:

010:019 And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the
        hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities:
        for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.

010:020 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel
        had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter,
        till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them
        entered into fenced cities.

010:021 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah
        in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of
        Israel.

010:022 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
        those five kings unto me out of the cave.

010:023 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him
        out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron,
        the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of
        Eglon.

010:024 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
        Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said
        unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come
        near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they
        came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.

010:025 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be
        strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all
        your enemies against whom ye fight.

010:026 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged
        them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until
        the evening.

010:027 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
        that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees,
        and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and
        laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this
        very day.

010:028 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge
        of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them,
        and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and
        he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of
        Jericho.

010:029 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him,
        unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:

010:030 And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the
        hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword,
        and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it;
        but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of
        Jericho.

010:031 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
        Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:

010:032 And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which
        took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the
        sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all
        that he had done to Libnah.

010:033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
        smote him and his people, until he had left him none
        remaining.

010:034 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with
        him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:

010:035 And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of
        the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly
        destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to
        Lachish.

010:036 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
        Hebron; and they fought against it:

010:037 And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
        the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the
        souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to
        all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and
        all the souls that were therein.

010:038 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
        fought against it:

010:039 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities
        thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and
        utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left
        none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir,
        and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to
        her king.

010:040 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the
        south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their
        kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that
        breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.

010:041 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and
        all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

010:042 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one
        time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.

010:043 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
        Gilgal.

011:001 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those
        things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king
        of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

011:002 And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and
        of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in
        the borders of Dor on the west,

011:003 And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the
        Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite
        in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land
        of Mizpeh.

011:004 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much
        people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in
        multitude, with horses and chariots very many.

011:005 And when all these kings were met together, they came and
        pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against
        Israel.

011:006 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them:
        for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain
        before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their
        chariots with fire.

011:007 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against
        them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

011:008 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote
        them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto
        Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and
        they smote them, until they left them none remaining.

011:009 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed
        their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.

011:010 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote
        the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the
        head of all those kingdoms.

011:011 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge
        of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left
        to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.

011:012 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
        did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword,
        and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the
        LORD commanded.

011:013 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength,
        Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua
        burn.

011:014 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the
        children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every
        man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had
        destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.

011:015 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command
        Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that
        the LORD commanded Moses.

011:016 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
        country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the
        plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;

011:017 Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto
        Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all
        their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.

011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.

011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children of
        Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other
        they took in battle.

011:020 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they
        should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy
        them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he
        might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.

011:021 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
        mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all
        the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel:
        Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.

011:022 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children
        of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there
        remained.

011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
        said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto
        Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the
        land rested from war.

012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of
        Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side
        Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto
        mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:

012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled
        from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and
        from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto
        the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of
        Ammon;

012:003 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and
        unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the
        way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:

012:004 And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant
        of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

012:005 And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan,
        unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and
        half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

012:006 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of
        Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a
        possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
        tribe of Manasseh.

012:007 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the
        children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from
        Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak,
        that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of
        Israel for a possession according to their divisions;

012:008 In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and
        in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south
        country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the
        Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:

012:009 The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside
        Bethel, one;

012:010 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

012:011 The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

012:012 The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

012:013 The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

012:014 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

012:015 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

012:016 The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

012:017 The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

012:018 The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;

012:019 The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

012:020 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

012:021 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

012:022 The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;

012:023 The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the
        nations of Gilgal, one;

012:024 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.

013:001 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said
        unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there
        remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.

013:002 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
        Philistines, and all Geshuri,

013:003 From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of
        Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords
        of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the
        Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the
        Avites:

013:004 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
        that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the
        Amorites:

013:005 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the
        sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering
        into Hamath.

013:006 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
        Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out
        from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot
        unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded
        thee.

013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the
        nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

013:008 With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their
        inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward,
        even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;

013:009 From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the
        city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of
        Medeba unto Dibon;

013:010 And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which
        reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;

013:011 And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites,
        and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;

013:012 All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth
        and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for
        these did Moses smite, and cast them out.

013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the
        Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the
        Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.

013:014 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
        sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their
        inheritance, as he said unto them.

013:015 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben
        inheritance according to their families.

013:016 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the
        river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river,
        and all the plain by Medeba;

013:017 Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and
        Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,

013:018 And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

013:019 And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of
        the valley,

013:020 And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,

013:021 And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
        king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses
        smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and
        Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the
        country.

013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
        of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by
        them.

013:023 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the
        border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of
        Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages
        thereof.

013:024 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto
        the children of Gad according to their families.

013:025 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and
        half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is
        before Rabbah;

013:026 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from
        Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

013:027 And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and
        Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,
        Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of
        Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.

013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
        families, the cities, and their villages.

013:029 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh:
        and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children
        of Manasseh by their families.

013:030 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
        of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in
        Bashan, threescore cities:

013:031 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the
        kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of
        Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the
        children of Machir by their families.

013:032 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for
        inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan,
        by Jericho, eastward.

013:033 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the
        LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto
        them.

014:001 And these are the countries which the children of Israel
        inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and
        Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the
        tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance
        to them.

014:002 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the
        hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
        tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave
        none inheritance among them.

014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and
        Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the
        land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their
        cattle and for their substance.

014:005 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did,
        and they divided the land.

014:006 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and
        Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou
        knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God
        concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.

014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent
        me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him
        word again as it was in mine heart.

014:008 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart
        of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.

014:009 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
        thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy
        children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the
        LORD my God.

014:010 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said,
        these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this
        word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the
        wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five
        years old.

014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses
        sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now,
        for war, both to go out, and to come in.

014:012 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in
        that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were
        there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the
        LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out,
        as the LORD said.

014:013 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of
        Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.

014:014 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
        Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly
        followed the LORD God of Israel.

014:015 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was
        a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

015:001 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by
        their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of
        Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.

015:002 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea,
        from the bay that looketh southward:

015:003 And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and
        passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto
        Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar,
        and fetched a compass to Karkaa:

015:004 From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the
        river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the
        sea: this shall be your south coast.

015:005 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of
        Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay
        of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:

015:006 And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the
        north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of
        Bohan the son of Reuben:

015:007 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor,
        and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the
        going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river:
        and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the
        goings out thereof were at Enrogel:

015:008 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto
        the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the
        border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before
        the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the
        valley of the giants northward:

015:009 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
        fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities
        of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is
        Kirjathjearim:

015:010 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
        and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is
        Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and
        passed on to Timnah:

015:011 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and
        the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount
        Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the
        border were at the sea.

015:012 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast
        thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round
        about according to their families.

015:013 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
        children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to
        Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city
        is Hebron.

015:014 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
        Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

015:015 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the
        name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.

015:016 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

015:017 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
        and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

015:018 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him
        to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and
        Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?

015:019 Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a
        south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the
        upper springs, and the nether springs.

015:020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
        according to their families.

015:021 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
        toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and
        Jagur,

015:022 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

015:023 And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

015:024 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

015:025 And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,

015:026 Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,

015:027 And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,

015:028 And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,

015:029 Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,

015:030 And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,

015:031 And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,

015:032 And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities
        are twenty and nine, with their villages:

015:033 And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,

015:034 And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,

015:035 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

015:036 And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim;
        fourteen cities with their villages:

015:037 Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,

015:038 And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,

015:039 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,

015:040 And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,

015:041 And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen
        cities with their villages:

015:042 Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,

015:043 And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,

015:044 And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their
        villages:

015:045 Ekron, with her towns and her villages:

015:046 From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with
        their villages:

015:047 Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns
        and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea,
        and the border thereof:

015:048 And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,

015:049 And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,

015:050 And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,

015:051 And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their
        villages:

015:052 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,

015:053 And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,

015:054 And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine
        cities with their villages:

015:055 Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,

015:056 And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,

015:057 Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:

015:058 Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,

015:059 And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their
        villages:

015:060 Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities
        with their villages:

015:061 In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,

015:062 And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with
        their villages.

015:063 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the
        children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites
        dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.

016:001 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by
        Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the
        wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,

016:002 And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the
        borders of Archi to Ataroth,

016:003 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the
        coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings
        out thereof are at the sea.

016:004 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
        inheritance.

016:005 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their
        families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the
        east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;

016:006 And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the
        north side; and the border went about eastward unto
        Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;

016:007 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and
        came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

016:008 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river
        Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the
        inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their
        families.

016:009 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among
        the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities
        with their villages.

016:010 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but
        the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and
        serve under tribute.

017:001 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
        firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of
        Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war,
        therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.

017:002 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh
        by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the
        children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the
        children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for
        the children of Shemida: these were the male children of
        Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.

017:003 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son
        of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters:
        and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah,
        Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

017:004 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before
        Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The
        LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our
        brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD
        he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their
        father.

017:005 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
        Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;

017:006 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his
        sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.

017:007 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
        lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right
        hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.

017:008 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the
        border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;

017:009 And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the
        river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of
        Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of
        the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:

017:010 Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's,
        and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on
        the north, and in Issachar on the east.

017:011 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
        towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor
        and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and
        the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants
        of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.

017:012 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the
        inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in
        that land.

017:013 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
        strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not
        utterly drive them out.

017:014 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast
        thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I
        am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me
        hitherto?

017:015 And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get
        thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in
        the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim
        be too narrow for thee.

017:016 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for
        us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the
        valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean
        and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.

017:017 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
        to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great
        power: thou shalt not have one lot only:

017:018 But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou
        shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for
        thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron
        chariots, and though they be strong.

018:001 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
        together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the
        congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.

018:002 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
        which had not yet received their inheritance.

018:003 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye
        slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your
        fathers hath given you?

018:004 Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will
        send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and
        describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they
        shall come again to me.

018:005 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide
        in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall
        abide in their coasts on the north.

018:006 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and
        bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for
        you here before the LORD our God.

018:007 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of
        the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half
        the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond
        Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave
        them.

018:008 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that
        went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the
        land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here
        cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.

018:009 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it
        by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua
        to the host at Shiloh.

018:010 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and
        there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel
        according to their divisions.

018:011 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
        according to their families: and the coast of their lot came
        forth between the children of Judah and the children of
        Joseph.

018:012 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
        border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and
        went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out
        thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.

018:013 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side
        of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended
        to Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of
        the nether Bethhoron.

018:014 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of
        the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron
        southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal,
        which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this
        was the west quarter.

018:015 And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and
        the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of
        waters of Nephtoah:

018:016 And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth
        before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the
        valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley
        of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended
        to Enrogel,

018:017 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and
        went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up
        of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of
        Reuben,

018:018 And passed along toward the side over against Arabah
        northward, and went down unto Arabah:

018:019 And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah
        northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north
        bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the
        south coast.

018:020 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the
        inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof
        round about, according to their families.

018:021 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
        according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and
        the valley of Keziz,

018:022 And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

018:023 And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,

018:024 And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with
        their villages:

018:025 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

018:026 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

018:027 And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

018:028 And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and
        Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the
        inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their
        families.

019:001 And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of
        the children of Simeon according to their families: and their
        inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of
        Judah.

019:002 And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and
        Moladah,

019:003 And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,

019:004 And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

019:005 And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,

019:006 And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their
        villages:

019:007 Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their
        villages:

019:008 And all the villages that were round about these cities to
        Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of
        the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
        families.

019:009 Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the
        inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the
        children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the
        children of Simeon had their inheritance within the
        inheritance of them.

019:010 And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun
        according to their families: and the border of their
        inheritance was unto Sarid:

019:011 And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and
        reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before
        Jokneam;

019:012 And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the
        border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and
        goeth up to Japhia,

019:013 And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher,
        to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;

019:014 And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon:
        and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:

019:015 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and
        Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

019:016 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according
        to their families, these cities with their villages.

019:017 And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of
        Issachar according to their families.

019:018 And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and
        Shunem,

019:019 And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath,

019:020 And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

019:021 And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;

019:022 And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and
        Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan:
        sixteen cities with their villages.

019:023 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
        Issachar according to their families, the cities and their
        villages.

019:024 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of
        Asher according to their families.

019:025 And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and
        Achshaph,

019:026 And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel
        westward, and to Shihorlibnath;

019:027 And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to
        Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side
        of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left
        hand,

019:028 And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great
        Zidon;

019:029 And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city
        Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings
        thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:

019:030 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with
        their villages.

019:031 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.

019:032 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for
        the children of Naphtali according to their families.

019:033 And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and
        Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings
        thereof were at Jordan:

019:034 And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth
        out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the
        south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to
        Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.

019:035 And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath,
        and Chinnereth,

019:036 And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

019:037 And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor,

019:038 And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh;
        nineteen cities with their villages.

019:039 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
        Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their
        villages.

019:040 And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of
        Dan according to their families.

019:041 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and
        Irshemesh,

019:042 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

019:043 And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

019:044 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,

019:045 And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,

019:046 And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.

019:047 And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for
        them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against
        Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
        and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan,
        after the name of Dan their father.

019:048 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.

019:049 When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance
        by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to
        Joshua the son of Nun among them:

019:050 According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which
        he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the
        city, and dwelt therein.

019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and
        Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the
        tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance
        by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of
        dividing the country.

020:001 The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying,

020:002 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you
        cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of
        Moses:

020:003 That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and
        unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge
        from the avenger of blood.

020:004 And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall
        stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall
        declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they
        shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place,
        that he may dwell among them.

020:005 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall
        not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his
        neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.

020:006 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
        congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high
        priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer
        return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house,
        unto the city from whence he fled.

020:007 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and
        Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in
        the mountain of Judah.

020:008 And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they
        assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the
        tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad,
        and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.

020:009 These were the cities appointed for all the children of
        Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that
        whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither,
        and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he
        stood before the congregation.

021:001 Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto
        Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto
        the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of
        Israel;

021:002 And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,
        saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us
        cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.

021:003 And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their
        inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and
        their suburbs.

021:004 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and
        the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites,
        had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of
        Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

021:005 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the
        families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan,
        and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

021:006 And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of
        the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out
        of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of
        Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.

021:007 The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe
        of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe
        of Zebulun, twelve cities.

021:008 And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these
        cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand
        of Moses.

021:009 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and
        out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which
        are here mentioned by name.

021:010 Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the
        Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs
        was the first lot.

021:011 And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
        city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs
        thereof round about it.

021:012 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave
        they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

021:013 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with
        her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah
        with her suburbs,

021:014 And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,

021:015 And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,

021:016 And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and
        Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two
        tribes.

021:017 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs,
        Geba with her suburbs,

021:018 Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:019 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were
        thirteen cities with their suburbs.

021:020 And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which
        remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities
        of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

021:021 For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim,
        to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her
        suburbs,

021:022 And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs;
        four cities.

021:023 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs,
        Gibbethon with her suburbs,

021:024 Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:025 And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her
        suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.

021:026 All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of
        the children of Kohath that remained.

021:027 And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the
        Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave
        Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for
        the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.

021:028 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs,
        Dabareh with her suburbs,

021:029 Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:030 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon
        with her suburbs,

021:031 Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:032 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her
        suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor
        with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.

021:033 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

021:034 And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of
        the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her
        suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,

021:035 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:036 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and
        Jahazah with her suburbs,

021:037 Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:038 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her
        suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim
        with her suburbs,

021:039 Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities
        in all.

021:040 So all the cities for the children of Merari by their
        families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites,
        were by their lot twelve cities.

021:041 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the
        children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their
        suburbs.

021:042 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about
        them: thus were all these cities.

021:043 And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to
        give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt
        therein.

021:044 And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that
        he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all
        their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their
        enemies into their hand.

021:045 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had
        spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

022:001 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
        half tribe of Manasseh,

022:002 And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of
        the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I
        commanded you:

022:003 Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day,
        but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your
        God.

022:004 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren,
        as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto
        your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses
        the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.

022:005 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law,
        which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the
        LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
        commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with
        all your heart and with all your soul.

022:006 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto
        their tents.

022:007 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
        possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave
        Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And
        when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he
        blessed them,

022:008 And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto
        your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with
        gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much
        raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.

022:009 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
        half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the
        children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of
        Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their
        possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word
        of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

022:010 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the
        land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad
        and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan,
        a great altar to see to.

022:011 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of
        Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh
        have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the
        borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.

022:012 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole
        congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves
        together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.

022:013 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben,
        and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh,
        into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
        priest,

022:014 And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince
        throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head
        of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.

022:015 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children
        of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of
        Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,

022:016 Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass
        is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to
        turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have
        builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the
        LORD?

022:017 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are
        not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in
        the congregation of the LORD,

022:018 But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD?
        and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that
        to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of
        Israel.

022:019 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean,
        then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD,
        wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession
        among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against
        us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our
        God.

022:020 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the
        accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of
        Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.

022:021 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
        half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of
        the thousands of Israel,

022:022 The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and
        Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in
        transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)

022:023 That we have built us an altar to turn from following the
        LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering,
        or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself
        require it;

022:024 And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing,
        saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our
        children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of
        Israel?

022:025 For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye
        children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the
        LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from
        fearing the LORD.

022:026 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,
        not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:

022:027 But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our
        generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD
        before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices,
        and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say
        to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.

022:028 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say
        to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say
        again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our
        fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but
        it is a witness between us and you.

022:029 God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn
        this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt
        offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the
        altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.

022:030 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the
        congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were
        with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the
        children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased
        them.

022:031 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the
        children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the
        children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is
        among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against
        the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of
        the hand of the LORD.

022:032 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
        returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of
        Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to
        the children of Israel, and brought them word again.

022:033 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children
        of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against
        them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of
        Reuben and Gad dwelt.

022:034 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the
        altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD
        is God.

023:001 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given
        rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that
        Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.

023:002 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and
        for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers,
        and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:

023:003 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all
        these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that
        hath fought for you.

023:004 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that
        remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan,
        with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great
        sea westward.

023:005 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you,
        and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess
        their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.

023:006 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is
        written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not
        aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;

023:007 That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among
        you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause
        to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto
        them:

023:008 But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this
        day.

023:009 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and
        strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before
        you unto this day.

023:010 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God,
        he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.

023:011 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the
        LORD your God.

023:012 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
        of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall
        make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to
        you:

023:013 Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive
        out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be
        snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and
        thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land
        which the LORD your God hath given you.

023:014 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and
        ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one
        thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your
        God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and
        not one thing hath failed thereof.

023:015 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are
        come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall
        the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have
        destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God
        hath given you.

023:016 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,
        which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods,
        and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD
        be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off
        the good land which he hath given unto you.

024:001 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and
        called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for
        their judges, and for their officers; and they presented
        themselves before God.

024:002 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God
        of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood
        in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father
        of Nachor: and they served other gods.

024:003 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the
        flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and
        multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.

024:004 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau
        mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went
        down into Egypt.

024:005 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
        that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.

024:006 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the
        sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with
        chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.

024:007 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you
        and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered
        them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and
        ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.

024:008 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt
        on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave
        them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I
        destroyed them from before you.

024:009 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
        against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to
        curse you:

024:010 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you
        still: so I delivered you out of his hand.

024:011 And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men
        of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the
        Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
        Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered
        them into your hand.

024:012 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
        before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with
        thy sword, nor with thy bow.

024:013 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
        cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the
        vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.

024:014 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
        truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the
        other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.

024:015 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you
        this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your
        fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or
        the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for
        me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

024:016 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
        forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;

024:017 For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our
        fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
        and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us
        in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people
        through whom we passed:

024:018 And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the
        Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve
        the LORD; for he is our God.

024:019 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for
        he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive
        your transgressions nor your sins.

024:020 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will
        turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done
        you good.

024:021 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
        LORD.

024:022 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against
        yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And
        they said, We are witnesses.

024:023 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are
        among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.

024:024 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we
        serve, and his voice will we obey.

024:025 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
        them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

024:026 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God,
        and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that
        was by the sanctuary of the LORD.

024:027 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall
        be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the
        LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness
        unto you, lest ye deny your God.

024:028 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his
        inheritance.

024:029 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of
        Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten
        years old.

024:030 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
        Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of
        the hill of Gaash.

024:031 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
        days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known
        all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.

024:032 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
        up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground
        which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem
        for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance
        of the children of Joseph.

024:033 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a
        hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him
        in mount Ephraim.

Book 07	Judges

001:001 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the
        children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for
        us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?

001:002 And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered
        the land into his hand.

001:003 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into
        my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I
        likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with
        him.

001:004 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and
        the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek
        ten thousand men.

001:005 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against
        him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.

001:006 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught
        him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

001:007 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their
        thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under
        my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they
        brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.

001:008 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and
        had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and
        set the city on fire.

001:009 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against
        the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south,
        and in the valley.

001:010 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron:
        (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew
        Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

001:011 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and
        the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:

001:012 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

001:013 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took
        it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

001:014 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him
        to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her
        ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?

001:015 And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given
        me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave
        her the upper springs and the nether springs.

001:016 And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up
        out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into
        the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and
        they went and dwelt among the people.

001:017 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
        Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.
        And the name of the city was called Hormah.

001:018 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with
        the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

001:019 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants
        of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of
        the valley, because they had chariots of iron.

001:020 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he
        expelled thence the three sons of Anak.

001:021 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
        that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the
        children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.

001:022 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and
        the LORD was with them.

001:023 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name
        of the city before was Luz.)

001:024 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
        said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the
        city, and we will shew thee mercy.

001:025 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
        the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man
        and all his family.

001:026 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a
        city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name
        thereof unto this day.

001:027 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean
        and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants
        of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her
        towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the
        Canaanites would dwell in that land.

001:028 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
        Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.

001:029 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in
        Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.

001:030 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor
        the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among
        them, and became tributaries.

001:031 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
        inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of
        Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:

001:032 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
        of the land: for they did not drive them out.

001:033 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,
        nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the
        Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the
        inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries
        unto them.

001:034 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:
        for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:

001:035 But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
        Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so
        that they became tributaries.

001:036 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to
        Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

002:001 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and
        said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you
        unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I
        will never break my covenant with you.

002:002 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land;
        ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my
        voice: why have ye done this?

002:003 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before
        you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods
        shall be a snare unto you.

002:004 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these
        words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted
        up their voice, and wept.

002:005 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they
        sacrificed there unto the LORD.

002:006 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel
        went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.

002:007 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all
        the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all
        the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

002:008 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died,
        being an hundred and ten years old.

002:009 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
        Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of
        the hill Gaash.

002:010 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:
        and there arose another generation after them, which knew not
        the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.

002:011 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
        and served Baalim:

002:012 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought
        them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the
        gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed
        themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.

002:013 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.

002:014 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
        delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them,
        and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about,
        so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.

002:015 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against
        them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn
        unto them: and they were greatly distressed.

002:016 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them
        out of the hand of those that spoiled them.

002:017 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they
        went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto
        them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers
        walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did
        not so.

002:018 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was
        with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their
        enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD
        because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed
        them and vexed them.

002:019 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they
        returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in
        following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them;
        they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn
        way.

002:020 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,
        Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I
        commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;

002:021 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of
        the nations which Joshua left when he died:

002:022 That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
        the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep
        it, or not.

002:023 Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them
        out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of
        Joshua.

003:001 Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel
        by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars
        of Canaan;

003:002 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might
        know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew
        nothing thereof;

003:003 Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
        and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount
        Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

003:004 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they
        would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he
        commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

003:005 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites,
        Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and
        Jebusites:

003:006 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave
        their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

003:007 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
        and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the
        groves.

003:008 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
        sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of
        Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served
        Chushanrishathaim eight years.

003:009 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
        raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered
        them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

003:010 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged
        Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered
        Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his
        hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.

003:011 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of
        Kenaz died.

003:012 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
        LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against
        Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

003:013 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and
        went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

003:014 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab
        eighteen years.

003:015 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
        raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite,
        a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a
        present unto Eglon the king of Moab.

003:016 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit
        length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right
        thigh.

003:017 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon
        was a very fat man.

003:018 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away
        the people that bare the present.

003:019 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
        Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king:
        who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out
        from him.

003:020 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer
        parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have
        a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.

003:021 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his
        right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

003:022 And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed
        upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of
        his belly; and the dirt came out.

003:023 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of
        the parlour upon him, and locked them.

003:024 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw
        that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said,
        Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

003:025 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he
        opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a
        key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down
        dead on the earth.

003:026 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
        quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

003:027 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet
        in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went
        down with him from the mount, and he before them.

003:028 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath
        delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they
        went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab,
        and suffered not a man to pass over.

003:029 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all
        lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

003:030 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the
        land had rest fourscore years.

003:031 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
        Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also
        delivered Israel.

004:001 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
        LORD, when Ehud was dead.

004:002 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
        that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera,
        which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.

004:003 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had
        nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily
        oppressed the children of Israel.

004:004 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged
        Israel at that time.

004:005 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
        Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to
        her for judgment.

004:006 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
        Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of
        Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and
        take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali
        and of the children of Zebulun?

004:007 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the
        captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude;
        and I will deliver him into thine hand.

004:008 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will
        go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.

004:009 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
        journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for
        the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And
        Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.

004:010 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went
        up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with
        him.

004:011 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
        father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites,
        and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by
        Kedesh.

004:012 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone
        up to mount Tabor.

004:013 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine
        hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with
        him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

004:014 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which
        the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the
        LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount
        Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

004:015 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
        his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that
        Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his
        feet.

004:016 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
        Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell
        upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.

004:017 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the
        wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin
        the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

004:018 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in,
        my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in
        unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

004:019 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to
        drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and
        gave him drink, and covered him.

004:020 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
        shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say,
        Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.

004:021 Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
        hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the
        nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he
        was fast asleep and weary. So he died.

004:022 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet
        him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man
        whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold,
        Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.

004:023 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
        children of Israel.

004:024 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and
        prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had
        destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

005:001 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
        saying,

005:002 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people
        willingly offered themselves.

005:003 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing
        unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.

005:004 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out
        of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens
        dropped, the clouds also dropped water.

005:005 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai
        from before the LORD God of Israel.

005:006 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
        the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked
        through byways.

005:007 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
        until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.

005:008 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a
        shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

005:009 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered
        themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.

005:010 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment,
        and walk by the way.

005:011 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the
        places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the
        righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the
        inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people
        of the LORD go down to the gates.

005:012 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise,
        Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

005:013 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
        among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the
        mighty.

005:014 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after
        thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down
        governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the
        writer.

005:015 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar,
        and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the
        divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.

005:016 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings
        of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great
        searchings of heart.

005:017 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
        Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

005:018 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
        unto the death in the high places of the field.

005:019 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in
        Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

005:020 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
        against Sisera.

005:021 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the
        river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

005:022 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,
        the pransings of their mighty ones.

005:023 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly
        the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of
        the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.

005:024 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite
        be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

005:025 He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth
        butter in a lordly dish.

005:026 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the
        workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she
        smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through
        his temples.

005:027 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he
        bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

005:028 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through
        the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry
        the wheels of his chariots?

005:029 Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to
        herself,

005:030 Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every
        man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a
        prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of
        needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take
        the spoil?

005:031 So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that
        love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And
        the land had rest forty years.

006:001 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD:
        and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven
        years.

006:002 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because
        of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens
        which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.

006:003 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came
        up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even
        they came up against them;

006:004 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of
        the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance
        for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

006:005 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they
        came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their
        camels were without number: and they entered into the land to
        destroy it.

006:006 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites;
        and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.

006:007 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto
        the LORD because of the Midianites,

006:008 That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel,
        which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I
        brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the
        house of bondage;

006:009 And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out
        of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from
        before you, and gave you their land;

006:010 And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods
        of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not
        obeyed my voice.

006:011 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak
        which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite:
        and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it
        from the Midianites.

006:012 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto
        him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

006:013 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us,
        why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his
        miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the
        LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken
        us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

006:014 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might,
        and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites:
        have not I sent thee?

006:015 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save
        Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the
        least in my father's house.

006:016 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and
        thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.

006:017 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
        then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

006:018 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and
        bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I
        will tarry until thou come again.

006:019 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes
        of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put
        the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak,
        and presented it.

006:020 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the
        unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out
        the broth. And he did so.

006:021 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that
        was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened
        cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed
        the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD
        departed out of his sight.

006:022 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,
        Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an
        angel of the LORD face to face.

006:023 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou
        shalt not die.

006:024 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it
        Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the
        Abiezrites.

006:025 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto
        him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock
        of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy
        father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:

006:026 And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this
        rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and
        offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou
        shalt cut down.

006:027 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD
        had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his
        father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not
        do it by day, that he did it by night.

006:028 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning,
        behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut
        down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon
        the altar that was built.

006:029 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And
        when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of
        Joash hath done this thing.

006:030 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son,
        that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal,
        and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.

006:031 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead
        for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let
        him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god,
        let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his
        altar.

006:032 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let
        Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.

006:033 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of
        the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in
        the valley of Jezreel.

006:034 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a
        trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.

006:035 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was
        gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and
        unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet
        them.

006:036 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine
        hand, as thou hast said,

006:037 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the
        dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth
        beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine
        hand, as thou hast said.

006:038 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust
        the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a
        bowl full of water.

006:039 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against
        me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee,
        but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the
        fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.

006:040 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece
        only, and there was dew on all the ground.

007:001 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were
        with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod:
        so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of
        them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

007:002 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee
        are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands,
        lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand
        hath saved me.

007:003 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people,
        saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and
        depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the
        people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten
        thousand.

007:004 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many;
        bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee
        there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This
        shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of
        whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the
        same shall not go.

007:005 So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD
        said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his
        tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself;
        likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.

007:006 And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to
        their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the
        people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.

007:007 And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that
        lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine
        hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his
        place.

007:008 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets:
        and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent,
        and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian
        was beneath him in the valley.

007:009 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto
        him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered
        it into thine hand.

007:010 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant
        down to the host:

007:011 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine
        hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he
        down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men
        that were in the host.

007:012 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of
        the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for
        multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand
        by the sea side for multitude.

007:013 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a
        dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream,
        and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of
        Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and
        overturned it, that the tent lay along.

007:014 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save
        the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for
        into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.

007:015 And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and
        the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned
        into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath
        delivered into your hand the host of Midian.

007:016 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and
        he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and
        lamps within the pitchers.

007:017 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and,
        behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be
        that, as I do, so shall ye do.

007:018 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then
        blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and
        say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

007:019 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto
        the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch;
        and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the
        trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.

007:020 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the
        pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the
        trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried,
        The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

007:021 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp;
        and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.

007:022 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set
        every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the
        host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the
        border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.

007:023 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
        Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and
        pursued after the Midianites.

007:024 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim,
        saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them
        the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of
        Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto
        Bethbarah and Jordan.

007:025 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb;
        and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at
        the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the
        heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

008:001 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us
        thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight
        with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.

008:002 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of
        you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than
        the vintage of Abiezer?

008:003 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb
        and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then
        their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.

008:004 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three
        hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.

008:005 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves
        of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint,
        and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

008:006 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and
        Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto
        thine army?

008:007 And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah
        and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with
        the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.

008:008 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise:
        and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had
        answered him.

008:009 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come
        again in peace, I will break down this tower.

008:010 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with
        them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all
        the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an
        hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.

008:011 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on
        the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the
        host was secure.

008:012 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and
        took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and
        discomfited all the host.

008:013 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the
        sun was up,

008:014 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of
        him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the
        elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.

008:015 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah
        and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the
        hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should
        give bread unto thy men that are weary?

008:016 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the
        wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of
        Succoth.

008:017 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the
        city.

008:018 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
        they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so
        were they; each one resembled the children of a king.

008:019 And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my
        mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I
        would not slay you.

008:020 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But
        the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was
        yet a youth.

008:021 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for
        as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew
        Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on
        their camels' necks.

008:022 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us,
        both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast
        delivered us from the hand of Midian.

008:023 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither
        shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.

008:024 And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you,
        that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For
        they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)

008:025 And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they
        spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings
        of his prey.

008:026 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
        thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments,
        and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of
        Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels'
        necks.

008:027 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even
        in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it:
        which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.

008:028 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that
        they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in
        quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.

008:029 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own
        house.

008:030 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten:
        for he had many wives.

008:031 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a
        son, whose name he called Abimelech.

008:032 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was
        buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the
        Abiezrites.

008:033 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the
        children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after
        Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.

008:034 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God,
        who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies
        on every side:

008:035 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,
        namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
        shewed unto Israel.

009:001 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his
        mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the
        family of the house of his mother's father, saying,

009:002 Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem,
        Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of
        Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over
        you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your
        bone and your flesh.

009:003 And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the
        men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to
        follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.

009:004 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of
        the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and
        light persons, which followed him.

009:005 And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his
        brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten
        persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the
        youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.

009:006 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the
        house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the
        plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.

009:007 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top
        of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said
        unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may
        hearken unto you.

009:008 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and
        they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.

009:009 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
        wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted
        over the trees?

009:010 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over
        us.

009:011 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my
        sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the
        trees?

009:012 Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over
        us.

009:013 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
        cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

009:014 Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign
        over us.

009:015 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me
        king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and
        if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the
        cedars of Lebanon.

009:016 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye
        have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with
        Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to
        the deserving of his hands;

009:017 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far,
        and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:

009:018 And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and
        have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one
        stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant,
        king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)

009:019 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and
        with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let
        him also rejoice in you:

009:020 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the
        men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out
        from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and
        devour Abimelech.

009:021 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt
        there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.

009:022 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,

009:023 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of
        Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with
        Abimelech:

009:024 That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of
        Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech
        their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem,
        which aided him in the killing of his brethren.

009:025 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of
        the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by
        them: and it was told Abimelech.

009:026 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over
        to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in
        him.

009:027 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their
        vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into
        the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed
        Abimelech.

009:028 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is
        Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of
        Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the
        father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?

009:029 And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I
        remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine
        army, and come out.

009:030 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal
        the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.

009:031 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,
        Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and,
        behold, they fortify the city against thee.

009:032 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with
        thee, and lie in wait in the field:

009:033 And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is
        up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold,
        when he and the people that is with him come out against thee,
        then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.

009:034 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him,
        by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four
        companies.

009:035 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering
        of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people
        that were with him, from lying in wait.

009:036 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there
        come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said
        unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they
        were men.

009:037 And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by
        the middle of the land, and another company come along by the
        plain of Meonenim.

009:038 Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith
        thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is
        not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray
        now, and fight with them.

009:039 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
        Abimelech.

009:040 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many
        were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the
        gate.

009:041 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and
        his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.

009:042 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out
        into the field; and they told Abimelech.

009:043 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,
        and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the
        people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against
        them, and smote them.

009:044 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed
        forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city:
        and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were
        in the fields, and slew them.

009:045 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he
        took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat
        down the city, and sowed it with salt.

009:046 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they
        entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.

009:047 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of
        Shechem were gathered together.

009:048 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the
        people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his
        hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and
        laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were
        with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I
        have done.

009:049 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and
        followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold
        on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem
        died also, about a thousand men and women.

009:050 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
        and took it.

009:051 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled
        all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it
        to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.

009:052 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and
        went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.

009:053 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon
        Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.

009:054 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer,
        and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say
        not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him
        through, and he died.

009:055 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they
        departed every man unto his place.

009:056 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
        unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:

009:057 And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon
        their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of
        Jerubbaal.

010:001 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son
        of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in
        Shamir in mount Ephraim.

010:002 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was
        buried in Shamir.

010:003 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel
        twenty and two years.

010:004 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they
        had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day,
        which are in the land of Gilead.

010:005 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

010:006 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
        LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria,
        and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of
        the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and
        forsook the LORD, and served not him.

010:007 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold
        them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of
        the children of Ammon.

010:008 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:
        eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the
        other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in
        Gilead.

010:009 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight
        also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the
        house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.

010:010 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We
        have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our
        God, and also served Baalim.

010:011 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I
        deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from
        the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?

010:012 The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did
        oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of
        their hand.

010:013 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I
        will deliver you no more.

010:014 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them
        deliver you in the time of your tribulation.

010:015 And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned:
        do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us
        only, we pray thee, this day.

010:016 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served
        the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

010:017 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and
        encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled
        themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.

010:018 And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What
        man is he that will begin to fight against the children of
        Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

011:001 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he
        was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.

011:002 And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up,
        and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt
        not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a
        strange woman.

011:003 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of
        Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went
        out with him.

011:004 And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of
        Ammon made war against Israel.

011:005 And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war
        against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah
        out of the land of Tob:

011:006 And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we
        may fight with the children of Ammon.

011:007 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate
        me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come
        unto me now when ye are in distress?

011:008 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn
        again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight
        against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the
        inhabitants of Gilead.

011:009 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me
        home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the
        LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?

011:010 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be
        witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.

011:011 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
        made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all
        his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.

011:012 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of
        Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art
        come against me to fight in my land?

011:013 And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the
        messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when
        they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and
        unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again
        peaceably.

011:014 And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the
        children of Ammon:

011:015 And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away
        the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:

011:016 But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the
        wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;

011:017 Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let
        me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom
        would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto
        the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode
        in Kadesh.

011:018 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the
        land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
        of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon,
        but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the
        border of Moab.

011:019 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
        the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we
        pray thee, through thy land into my place.

011:020 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but
        Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz,
        and fought against Israel.

011:021 And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people
        into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel
        possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of
        that country.

011:022 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon
        even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.

011:023 So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites
        from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?

011:024 Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee
        to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out
        from before us, them will we possess.

011:025 And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of
        Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or
        did he ever fight against them,

011:026 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and
        her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts
        of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not
        recover them within that time?

011:027 Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me
        wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day
        between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.

011:028 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto
        the words of Jephthah which he sent him.

011:029 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed
        over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,
        and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of
        Ammon.

011:030 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou
        shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine
        hands,

011:031 Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of
        my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children
        of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up
        for a burnt offering.

011:032 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight
        against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.

011:033 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,
        even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with
        a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were
        subdued before the children of Israel.

011:034 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
        daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances:
        and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor
        daughter.

011:035 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his
        clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me
        very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have
        opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.

011:036 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy
        mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath
        proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken
        vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of
        Ammon.

011:037 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me:
        let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the
        mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.

011:038 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she
        went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the
        mountains.

011:039 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she
        returned unto her father, who did with her according to his
        vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a
        custom in Israel,

011:040 That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the
        daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

012:001 And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
        northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou
        over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not
        call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee
        with fire.

012:002 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great
        strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye
        delivered me not out of their hands.

012:003 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my
        hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the
        LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come
        up unto me this day, to fight against me?

012:004 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and
        fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim,
        because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim
        among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.

012:005 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the
        Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which
        were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said
        unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;

012:006 Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said
        Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then
        they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and
        there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two
        thousand.

012:007 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the
        Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.

012:008 And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

012:009 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent
        abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.
        And he judged Israel seven years.

012:010 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.

012:011 And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged
        Israel ten years.

012:012 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
        country of Zebulun.

012:013 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged
        Israel.

012:014 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on
        threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight
        years.

012:015 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was
        buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the
        Amalekites.

013:001 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
        LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the
        Philistines forty years.

013:002 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
        Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and
        bare not.

013:003 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said
        unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but
        thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.

013:004 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor
        strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:

013:005 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor
        shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto
        God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of
        the hand of the Philistines.

013:006 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God
        came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of
        an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he
        was, neither told he me his name:

013:007 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a
        son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any
        unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from
        the womb to the day of his death.

013:008 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the
        man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach
        us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.

013:009 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God
        came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah
        her husband was not with her.

013:010 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and
        said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that
        came unto me the other day.

013:011 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the
        man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the
        woman? And he said, I am.

013:012 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we
        order the child, and how shall we do unto him?

013:013 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said
        unto the woman let her beware.

013:014 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither
        let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing:
        all that I commanded her let her observe.

013:015 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let
        us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

013:016 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain
        me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a
        burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah
        knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.

013:017 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,
        that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?

013:018 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus
        after my name, seeing it is secret?

013:019 So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon
        a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and
        Manoah and his wife looked on.

013:020 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from
        off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the
        flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and
        fell on their faces to the ground.

013:021 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to
        his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.

013:022 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we
        have seen God.

013:023 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill
        us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat
        offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all
        these things, nor would as at this time have told us such
        things as these.

013:024 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the
        child grew, and the LORD blessed him.

013:025 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the
        camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

014:001 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of
        the daughters of the Philistines.

014:002 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,
        I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the
        Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.

014:003 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a
        woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my
        people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised
        Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me;
        for she pleaseth me well.

014:004 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the
        LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for
        at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

014:005 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to
        Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a
        young lion roared against him.

014:006 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent
        him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his
        hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had
        done.

014:007 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
        Samson well.

014:008 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside
        to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm
        of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.

014:009 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came
        to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat:
        but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the
        carcase of the lion.

014:010 So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there
        a feast; for so used the young men to do.

014:011 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought
        thirty companions to be with him.

014:012 And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto
        you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days
        of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty
        sheets and thirty change of garments:

014:013 But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty
        sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him,
        Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.

014:014 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and
        out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in
        three days expound the riddle.

014:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto
        Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us
        the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with
        fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?

014:016 And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but
        hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto
        the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he
        said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my
        mother, and shall I tell it thee?

014:017 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast
        lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told
        her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to
        the children of her people.

014:018 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day
        before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what
        is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not
        plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

014:019 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to
        Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil,
        and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the
        riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his
        father's house.

014:020 But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used
        as his friend.

015:001 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
        harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said,
        I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would
        not suffer him to go in.

015:002 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
        hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her
        younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead
        of her.

015:003 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless
        than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.

015:004 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took
        firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in
        the midst between two tails.

015:005 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into
        the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the
        shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and
        olives.

015:006 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they
        answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he
        had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the
        Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.

015:007 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will
        I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

015:008 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he
        went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

015:009 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
        themselves in Lehi.

015:010 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And
        they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as
        he hath done to us.

015:011 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
        Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the
        Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast
        done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so
        have I done unto them.

015:012 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
        may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson
        said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me
        yourselves.

015:013 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee
        fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not
        kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought
        him up from the rock.

015:014 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against
        him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and
        the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was
        burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.

015:015 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,
        and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.

015:016 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
        with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.

015:017 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that
        he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that
        place Ramathlehi.

015:018 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said,
        Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy
        servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the
        hand of the uncircumcised?

015:019 But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there
        came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came
        again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof
        Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.

015:020 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty
        years.

016:001 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in
        unto her.

016:002 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither.
        And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in
        the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In
        the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.

016:003 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took
        the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went
        away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders,
        and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before
        Hebron.

016:004 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
        valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

016:005 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said
        unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength
        lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we
        may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one
        of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.

016:006 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
        great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to
        afflict thee.

016:007 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green
        withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as
        another man.

016:008 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven
        green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with
        them.

016:009 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the
        chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee,
        Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken
        when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.

016:010 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and
        told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou
        mightest be bound.

016:011 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that
        never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another
        man.

016:012 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and
        said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there
        were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them
        from off his arms like a thread.

016:013 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me,
        and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.
        And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my
        head with the web.

016:014 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The
        Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his
        sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the
        web.

016:015 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when
        thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three
        times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.

016:016 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her
        words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;

016:017 That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath
        not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite
        unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my
        strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like
        any other man.

016:018 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she
        sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come
        up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the
        lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money
        in their hand.

016:019 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a
        man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his
        head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from
        him.

016:020 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he
        awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other
        times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD
        was departed from him.

016:021 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and
        brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass;
        and he did grind in the prison house.

016:022 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
        shaven.

016:023 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for
        to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to
        rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our
        enemy into our hand.

016:024 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they
        said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the
        destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.

016:025 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they
        said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they
        called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them
        sport: and they set him between the pillars.

016:026 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer
        me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth,
        that I may lean upon them.

016:027 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of
        the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about
        three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made
        sport.

016:028 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God,
        remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only
        this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the
        Philistines for my two eyes.

016:029 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the
        house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his
        right hand, and of the other with his left.

016:030 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
        himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords,
        and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which
        he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his
        life.

016:031 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down,
        and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah
        and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he
        judged Israel twenty years.

017:001 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

017:002 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of
        silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst,
        and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with
        me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the
        LORD, my son.

017:003 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver
        to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the
        silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven
        image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto
        thee.

017:004 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took
        two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder,
        who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they
        were in the house of Micah.

017:005 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and
        teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his
        priest.

017:006 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did
        that which was right in his own eyes.

017:007 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family
        of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

017:008 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to
        sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount
        Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.

017:009 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto
        him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn
        where I may find a place.

017:010 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a
        father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of
        silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.
        So the Levite went in.

017:011 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the
        young man was unto him as one of his sons.

017:012 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his
        priest, and was in the house of Micah.

017:013 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,
        seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

018:001 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days
        the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell
        in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen
        unto them among the tribes of Israel.

018:002 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from
        their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to
        spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them,
        Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to
        the house of Micah, they lodged there.

018:003 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of
        the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said
        unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in
        this place? and what hast thou here?

018:004 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me,
        and hath hired me, and I am his priest.

018:005 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God,
        that we may know whether our way which we go shall be
        prosperous.

018:006 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is
        your way wherein ye go.

018:007 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the
        people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the
        manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no
        magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any
        thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no
        business with any man.

018:008 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and
        their brethren said unto them, What say ye?

018:009 And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we
        have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye
        still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the
        land.

018:010 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large
        land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where
        there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.

018:011 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out
        of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with
        weapons of war.

018:012 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah:
        wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day:
        behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.

018:013 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the
        house of Micah.

018:014 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
        Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is
        in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image,
        and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.

018:015 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the
        young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and
        saluted him.

018:016 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,
        which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of
        the gate.

018:017 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and
        came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and
        the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in
        the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were
        appointed with weapons of war.

018:018 And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved
        image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then
        said the priest unto them, What do ye?

018:019 And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon
        thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest:
        is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one
        man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in
        Israel?

018:020 And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and
        the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of
        the people.

018:021 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the
        cattle and the carriage before them.

018:022 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men
        that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered
        together, and overtook the children of Dan.

018:023 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
        faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest
        with such a company?

018:024 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the
        priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what
        is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?

018:025 And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be
        heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou
        lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.

018:026 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw
        that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back
        unto his house.

018:027 And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest
        which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at
        quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the
        sword, and burnt the city with fire.

018:028 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and
        they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley
        that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt
        therein.

018:029 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of
        Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name
        of the city was Laish at the first.

018:030 And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,
        the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were
        priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of
        the land.

018:031 And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all
        the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

019:001 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in
        Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side
        of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of
        Bethlehemjudah.

019:002 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
        from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was
        there four whole months.

019:003 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly
        unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him,
        and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's
        house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced
        to meet him.

019:004 And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and
        he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and
        lodged there.

019:005 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early
        in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's
        father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a
        morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.

019:006 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them
        together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be
        content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart
        be merry.

019:007 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged
        him: therefore he lodged there again.

019:008 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart;
        and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray
        thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both
        of them.

019:009 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and
        his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto
        him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you
        tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge
        here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you
        early on your way, that thou mayest go home.

019:010 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
        departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and
        there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was
        with him.

019:011 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the
        servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us
        turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

019:012 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither
        into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of
        Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.

019:013 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to
        one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in
        Ramah.

019:014 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
        upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to
        Benjamin.

019:015 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in
        Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of
        the city: for there was no man that took them into his house
        to lodging.

019:016 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the
        field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he
        sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.

019:017 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in
        the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest
        thou? and whence comest thou?

019:018 And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah
        toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went
        to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the
        LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.

019:019 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there
        is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for
        the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of
        any thing.

019:020 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all
        thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.

019:021 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the
        asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.

019:022 Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
        the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about,
        and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house,
        the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine
        house, that we may know him.

019:023 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and
        said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so
        wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not
        this folly.

019:024 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them
        I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them
        what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a
        thing.

019:025 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
        concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her,
        and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the
        day began to spring, they let her go.

019:026 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down
        at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was
        light.

019:027 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of
        the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman
        his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and
        her hands were upon the threshold.

019:028 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none
        answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man
        rose up, and gat him unto his place.

019:029 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid
        hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her
        bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of
        Israel.

019:030 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such
        deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel
        came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of
        it, take advice, and speak your minds.

020:001 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
        was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba,
        with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.

020:002 And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of
        Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of
        God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.

020:003 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of
        Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of
        Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?

020:004 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain,
        answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to
        Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.

020:005 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house
        round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me:
        and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.

020:006 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
        throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for
        they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

020:007 Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice
        and counsel.

020:008 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any
        of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his
        house.

020:009 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we
        will go up by lot against it;

020:010 And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the
        tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand
        out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that
        they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according
        to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.

020:011 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
        together as one man.

020:012 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of
        Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among
        you?

020:013 Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial,
        which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put
        away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not
        hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.

020:014 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out
        of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the
        children of Israel.

020:015 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of
        the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside
        the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred
        chosen men.

020:016 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
        lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth,
        and not miss.

020:017 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four
        hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of
        war.

020:018 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of
        God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go
        up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And
        the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.

020:019 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and
        encamped against Gibeah.

020:020 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and
        the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against
        them at Gibeah.

020:021 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and
        destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty
        and two thousand men.

020:022 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and
        set their battle again in array in the place where they put
        themselves in array the first day.

020:023 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD
        until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go
        up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my
        brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)

020:024 And the children of Israel came near against the children of
        Benjamin the second day.

020:025 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
        day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of
        Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.

020:026 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
        and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before
        the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt
        offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.

020:027 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark
        of the covenant of God was there in those days,

020:028 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood
        before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to
        battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I
        cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver
        them into thine hand.

020:029 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.

020:030 And the children of Israel went up against the children of
        Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against
        Gibeah, as at other times.

020:031 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and
        were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the
        people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which
        one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in
        the field, about thirty men of Israel.

020:032 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down
        before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said,
        Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.

020:033 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
        themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of
        Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows
        of Gibeah.

020:034 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of
        all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that
        evil was near them.

020:035 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of
        Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five
        thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.

020:036 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for
        the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they
        trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside
        Gibeah.

020:037 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the
        liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city
        with the edge of the sword.

020:038 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and
        the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with
        smoke rise up out of the city.

020:039 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin
        began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty
        persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before
        us, as in the first battle.

020:040 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
        pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and,
        behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.

020:041 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin
        were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.

020:042 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel
        unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them;
        and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the
        midst of them.

020:043 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased
        them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward
        the sunrising.

020:044 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these
        were men of valour.

020:045 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock
        of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five
        thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew
        two thousand men of them.

020:046 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and
        five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of
        valour.

020:047 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
        rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.

020:048 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of
        Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well
        the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to
        hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

021:001 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall
        not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.

021:002 And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till
        even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;

021:003 And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in
        Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in
        Israel?

021:004 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early,
        and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and
        peace offerings.

021:005 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the
        tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto
        the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that
        came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be
        put to death.

021:006 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their
        brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this
        day.

021:007 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have
        sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters
        to wives?

021:008 And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that
        came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came
        none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.

021:009 For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of
        the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.

021:010 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
        valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the
        inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with
        the women and the children.

021:011 And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly
        destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.

021:012 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four
        hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any
        male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is
        in the land of Canaan.

021:013 And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children
        of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call
        peaceably unto them.

021:014 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives
        which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and
        yet so they sufficed them not.

021:015 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the
        LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

021:016 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
        wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out
        of Benjamin?

021:017 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be
        escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of
        Israel.

021:018 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
        children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that
        giveth a wife to Benjamin.

021:019 Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh
        yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the
        east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem,
        and on the south of Lebonah.

021:020 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go
        and lie in wait in the vineyards;

021:021 And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to
        dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch
        you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to
        the land of Benjamin.

021:022 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come
        unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable
        unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man
        his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this
        time, that ye should be guilty.

021:023 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,
        according to their number, of them that danced, whom they
        caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and
        repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.

021:024 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every
        man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from
        thence every man to his inheritance.

021:025 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that
        which was right in his own eyes.

Book 08	Ruth

001:001 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that
        there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of
        Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and
        his wife, and his two sons.

001:002 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his
        wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,
        Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country
        of Moab, and continued there.

001:003 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her
        two sons.

001:004 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the
        one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they
        dwelled there about ten years.

001:005 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman
        was left of her two sons and her husband.

001:006 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might
        return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the
        country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in
        giving them bread.

001:007 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and
        her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to
        return unto the land of Judah.

001:008 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each
        to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye
        have dealt with the dead, and with me.

001:009 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the
        house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up
        their voice, and wept.

001:010 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto
        thy people.

001:011 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with
        me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be
        your husbands?

001:012 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to
        have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should
        have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;

001:013 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay
        for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it
        grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is
        gone out against me.

001:014 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah
        kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

001:015 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
        people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in
        law.

001:016 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
        following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and
        where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my
        people, and thy God my God:

001:017 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the
        LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee
        and me.

001:018 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her,
        then she left speaking unto her.

001:019 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to
        pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was
        moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?

001:020 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for
        the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

001:021 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:
        why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified
        against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?

001:022 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in
        law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and
        they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

002:001 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of
        wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

002:002 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
        field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall
        find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.

002:003 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
        reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field
        belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.

002:004 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the
        reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD
        bless thee.

002:005 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,
        Whose damsel is this?

002:006 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and
        said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out
        of the country of Moab:

002:007 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the
        reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued
        even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in
        the house.

002:008 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go
        not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but
        abide here fast by my maidens:

002:009 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou
        after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall
        not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the
        vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.

002:010 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
        and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that
        thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?

002:011 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed
        me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the
        death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and
        thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a
        people which thou knewest not heretofore.

002:012 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee
        of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to
        trust.

002:013 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for
        that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken
        friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of
        thine handmaidens.

002:014 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat
        of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat
        beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she
        did eat, and was sufficed, and left.

002:015 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young
        men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and
        reproach her not:

002:016 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and
        leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.

002:017 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she
        had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.

002:018 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in
        law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave
        to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.

002:019 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned
        to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take
        knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom
        she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought
        to day is Boaz.

002:020 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the
        LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to
        the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto
        us, one of our next kinsmen.

002:021 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt
        keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my
        harvest.

002:022 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
        daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet
        thee not in any other field.

002:023 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end
        of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her
        mother in law.

003:001 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall
        I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?

003:002 And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou
        wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the
        threshingfloor.

003:003 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment
        upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not
        thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating
        and drinking.

003:004 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the
        place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover
        his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou
        shalt do.

003:005 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

003:006 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all
        that her mother in law bade her.

003:007 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he
        went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came
        softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.

003:008 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and
        turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.

003:009 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine
        handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for
        thou art a near kinsman.

003:010 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for
        thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the
        beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether
        poor or rich.

003:011 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that
        thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that
        thou art a virtuous woman.

003:012 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there
        is a kinsman nearer than I.

003:013 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he
        will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do
        the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a
        kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee,
        as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.

003:014 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up
        before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be
        known that a woman came into the floor.

003:015 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and
        hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of
        barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.

003:016 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art
        thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done
        to her.

003:017 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he
        said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.

003:018 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
        matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he
        have finished the thing this day.

004:001 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,
        behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he
        said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned
        aside, and sat down.

004:002 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit
        ye down here. And they sat down.

004:003 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of
        the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our
        brother Elimelech's:

004:004 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the
        inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt
        redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then
        tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it
        beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem
        it.

004:005 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
        Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife
        of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his
        inheritance.

004:006 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I
        mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for
        I cannot redeem it.

004:007 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning
        redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things;
        a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and
        this was a testimony in Israel.

004:008 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he
        drew off his shoe.

004:009 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
        witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was
        Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the
        hand of Naomi.

004:010 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
        purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon
        his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from
        among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are
        witnesses this day.

004:011 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders,
        said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come
        into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did
        build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah,
        and be famous in Bethlehem:

004:012 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare
        unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this
        young woman.

004:013 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in
        unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.

004:014 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath
        not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be
        famous in Israel.

004:015 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a
        nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which
        loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath
        born him.

004:016 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
        nurse unto it.

004:017 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is
        a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the
        father of Jesse, the father of David.

004:018 Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,

004:019 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,

004:020 And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

004:021 And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,

004:022 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

Book 09	1 Samuel

001:001 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount
        Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son
        of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:

001:002 And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the
        name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but
        Hannah had no children.

001:003 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
        sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons
        of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were
        there.

001:004 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to
        Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters,
        portions:

001:005 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah:
        but the LORD had shut up her womb.

001:006 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her
        fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.

001:007 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house
        of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did
        not eat.

001:008 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest
        thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved?
        am not I better to thee than ten sons?

001:009 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
        they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post
        of the temple of the LORD.

001:010 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD,
        and wept sore.

001:011 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt
        indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember
        me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine
        handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all
        the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his
        head.

001:012 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,
        that Eli marked her mouth.

001:013 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but
        her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been
        drunken.

001:014 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away
        thy wine from thee.

001:015 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a
        sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,
        but have poured out my soul before the LORD.

001:016 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of
        the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken
        hitherto.

001:017 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel
        grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

001:018 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So
        the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was
        no more sad.

001:019 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before
        the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and
        Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.

001:020 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after
        Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name
        Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.

001:021 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto
        the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

001:022 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will
        not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring
        him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for
        ever.

001:023 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee
        good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD
        establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck
        until she weaned him.

001:024 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with
        three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine,
        and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the
        child was young.

001:025 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.

001:026 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am
        the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.

001:027 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my
        petition which I asked of him:

001:028 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he
        liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the
        LORD there.

002:001 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD,
        mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over
        mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.

002:002 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:
        neither is there any rock like our God.

002:003 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out
        of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him
        actions are weighed.

002:004 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled
        are girded with strength.

002:005 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and
        they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born
        seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.

002:006 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the
        grave, and bringeth up.

002:007 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and
        lifteth up.

002:008 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the
        beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to
        make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the
        earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.

002:009 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
        silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

002:010 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of
        heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the
        ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king,
        and exalt the horn of his anointed.

002:011 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
        minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.

002:012 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the
        LORD.

002:013 And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any
        man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the
        flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his
        hand;

002:014 And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;
        all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself.
        So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came
        thither.

002:015 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and
        said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the
        priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

002:016 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the
        fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth;
        then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now:
        and if not, I will take it by force.

002:017 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
        LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.

002:018 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded
        with a linen ephod.

002:019 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to
        him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to
        offer the yearly sacrifice.

002:020 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give
        thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the
        LORD. And they went unto their own home.

002:021 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare
        three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before
        the LORD.

002:022 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
        Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the
        door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

002:023 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of
        your evil dealings by all this people.

002:024 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make
        the LORD's people to transgress.

002:025 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but
        if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him?
        Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their
        father, because the LORD would slay them.

002:026 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
        LORD, and also with men.

002:027 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
        saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy
        father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?

002:028 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my
        priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an
        ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father
        all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?

002:029 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which
        I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons
        above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the
        offerings of Israel my people?

002:030 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy
        house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for
        ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that
        honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be
        lightly esteemed.

002:031 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the
        arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man
        in thine house.

002:032 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the
        wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an
        old man in thine house for ever.

002:033 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine
        altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine
        heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the
        flower of their age.

002:034 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy
        two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die
        both of them.

002:035 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do
        according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I
        will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine
        anointed for ever.

002:036 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in
        thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver
        and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee,
        into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of
        bread.

003:001 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And
        the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no
        open vision.

003:002 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in
        his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not
        see;

003:003 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD,
        where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;

003:004 That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.

003:005 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst
        me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and
        lay down.

003:006 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and
        went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And
        he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.

003:007 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of
        the LORD yet revealed unto him.

003:008 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose
        and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.
        And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.

003:009 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be,
        if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy
        servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

003:010 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
        Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant
        heareth.

003:011 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in
        Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it
        shall tingle.

003:012 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have
        spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an
        end.

003:013 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for
        the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made
        themselves vile, and he restrained them not.

003:014 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the
        iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor
        offering for ever.

003:015 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
        house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

003:016 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he
        answered, Here am I.

003:017 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto
        thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and
        more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things
        that he said unto thee.

003:018 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And
        he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.

003:019 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none
        of his words fall to the ground.

003:020 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
        established to be a prophet of the LORD.

003:021 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed
        himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

004:001 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
        against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside
        Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.

004:002 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:
        and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the
        Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four
        thousand men.

004:003 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of
        Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before
        the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it
        may save us out of the hand of our enemies.

004:004 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from
        thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which
        dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli,
        Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant
        of God.

004:005 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the
        camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth
        rang again.

004:006 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they
        said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp
        of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD
        was come into the camp.

004:007 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come
        into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not
        been such a thing heretofore.

004:008 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these
        mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with
        all the plagues in the wilderness.

004:009 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that
        ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you:
        quit yourselves like men, and fight.

004:010 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they
        fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great
        slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.

004:011 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
        and Phinehas, were slain.

004:012 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
        Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon
        his head.

004:013 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
        watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when
        the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried
        out.

004:014 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What
        meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily,
        and told Eli.

004:015 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,
        that he could not see.

004:016 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army,
        and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there
        done, my son?

004:017 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the
        Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among
        the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are
        dead, and the ark of God is taken.

004:018 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God,
        that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the
        gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man,
        and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.

004:019 And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near
        to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark
        of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband
        were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came
        upon her.

004:020 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her
        said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she
        answered not, neither did she regard it.

004:021 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
        from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of
        her father in law and her husband.

004:022 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark
        of God is taken.

005:001 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
        Ebenezer unto Ashdod.

005:002 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into
        the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

005:003 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold,
        Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of
        the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.

005:004 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon
        was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the
        LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands
        were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was
        left to him.

005:005 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
        Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto
        this day.

005:006 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
        destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and
        the coasts thereof.

005:007 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The
        ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand
        is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.

005:008 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the
        Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark
        of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the
        God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the
        ark of the God of Israel about thither.

005:009 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand
        of the LORD was against the city with a very great
        destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and
        great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.

005:010 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to
        pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites
        cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God
        of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.

005:011 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
        Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel,
        and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and
        our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all
        the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.

005:012 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and
        the cry of the city went up to heaven.

006:001 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
        seven months.

006:002 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
        saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us
        wherewith we shall send it to his place.

006:003 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel,
        send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass
        offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to
        you why his hand is not removed from you.

006:004 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we
        shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and
        five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the
        Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.

006:005 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of
        your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the
        God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off
        you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.

006:006 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
        Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully
        among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?

006:007 Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on
        which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart,
        and bring their calves home from them:

006:008 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and
        put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass
        offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away,
        that it may go.

006:009 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
        Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not,
        then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it
        was a chance that happened to us.

006:010 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to
        the cart, and shut up their calves at home:

006:011 And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the
        coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.

006:012 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh,
        and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned
        not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of
        the Philistines went after them unto the border of
        Bethshemesh.

006:013 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in
        the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark,
        and rejoiced to see it.

006:014 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and
        stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the
        wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto
        the LORD.

006:015 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
        that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put
        them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered
        burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto
        the LORD.

006:016 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
        returned to Ekron the same day.

006:017 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines
        returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod
        one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron
        one;

006:018 And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities
        of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced
        cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of
        Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone
        remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the
        Bethshemite.

006:019 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked
        into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty
        thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented,
        because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great
        slaughter.

006:020 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before
        this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?

006:021 And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim,
        saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the
        LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.

007:001 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of
        the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the
        hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the
        LORD.

007:002 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim,
        that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the
        house of Israel lamented after the LORD.

007:003 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye
        do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away
        the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare
        your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will
        deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

007:004 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth,
        and served the LORD only.

007:005 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray
        for you unto the LORD.

007:006 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and
        poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and
        said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged
        the children of Israel in Mizpeh.

007:007 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel
        were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines
        went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard
        it, they were afraid of the Philistines.

007:008 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry
        unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the
        hand of the Philistines.

007:009 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt
        offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD
        for Israel; and the LORD heard him.

007:010 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the
        Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD
        thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the
        Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten
        before Israel.

007:011 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
        Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.

007:012 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen,
        and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the
        LORD helped us.

007:013 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into
        the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the
        Philistines all the days of Samuel.

007:014 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel
        were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the
        coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the
        Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the
        Amorites.

007:015 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

007:016 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and
        Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.

007:017 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and
        there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the
        LORD.

008:001 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his
        sons judges over Israel.

008:002 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
        second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.

008:003 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after
        lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

008:004 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,
        and came to Samuel unto Ramah,

008:005 And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not
        in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the
        nations.

008:006 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a
        king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

008:007 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
        people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not
        rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not
        reign over them.

008:008 According to all the works which they have done since the day
        that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day,
        wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do
        they also unto thee.

008:009 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest
        solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that
        shall reign over them.

008:010 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
        asked of him a king.

008:011 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall
        reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for
        himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some
        shall run before his chariots.

008:012 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
        over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap
        his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and
        instruments of his chariots.

008:013 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to
        be cooks, and to be bakers.

008:014 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
        oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his
        servants.

008:015 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your
        vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.

008:016 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and
        your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his
        work.

008:017 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
        servants.

008:018 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
        shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that
        day.

008:019 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel;
        and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;

008:020 That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king
        may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

008:021 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
        them in the ears of the LORD.

008:022 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and
        make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go
        ye every man unto his city.

009:001 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son
        of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of
        Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.

009:002 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and
        a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a
        goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was
        higher than any of the people.

009:003 And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said
        to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and
        arise, go seek the asses.

009:004 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the
        land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed
        through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he
        passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them
        not.

009:005 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
        servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my
        father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.

009:006 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man
        of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh
        surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can
        shew us our way that we should go.

009:007 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what
        shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels,
        and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what
        have we?

009:008 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have
        here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will
        I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.

009:009 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus
        he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now
        called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)

009:010 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So
        they went unto the city where the man of God was.

009:011 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young
        maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the
        seer here?

009:012 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before
        you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there
        is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:

009:013 As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find
        him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people
        will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the
        sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now
        therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.

009:014 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into
        the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up
        to the high place.

009:015 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul
        came, saying,

009:016 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the
        land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over
        my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand
        of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because
        their cry is come unto me.

009:017 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the
        man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my
        people.

009:018 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me,
        I pray thee, where the seer's house is.

009:019 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up
        before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to
        day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all
        that is in thine heart.

009:020 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not
        thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the
        desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's
        house?

009:021 And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the
        smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of
        all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then
        speakest thou so to me?

009:022 And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into
        the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among
        them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.

009:023 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave
        thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

009:024 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,
        and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is
        left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it
        been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So
        Saul did eat with Samuel that day.

009:025 And when they were come down from the high place into the
        city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

009:026 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of
        the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house,
        saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and
        they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.

009:027 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel
        said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he
        passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee
        the word of God.

010:001 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head,
        and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath
        anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?

010:002 When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find
        two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at
        Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou
        wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the
        care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I
        do for my son?

010:003 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come
        to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men
        going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and
        another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a
        bottle of wine:

010:004 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;
        which thou shalt receive of their hands.

010:005 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the
        garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when
        thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a
        company of prophets coming down from the high place with a
        psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them;
        and they shall prophesy:

010:006 And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt
        prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.

010:007 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou
        do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.

010:008 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I
        will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to
        sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou
        tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.

010:009 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
        Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came
        to pass that day.

010:010 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
        prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he
        prophesied among them.

010:011 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw
        that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the
        people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the
        son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?

010:012 And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their
        father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the
        prophets?

010:013 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the
        high place.

010:014 And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither
        went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that
        they were no where, we came to Samuel.

010:015 And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said
        unto you.

010:016 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the
        asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof
        Samuel spake, he told him not.

010:017 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;

010:018 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God
        of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you
        out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all
        kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:

010:019 And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you
        out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have
        said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore
        present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your
        thousands.

010:020 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come
        near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

010:021 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
        families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of
        Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be
        found.

010:022 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should
        yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid
        himself among the stuff.

010:023 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among
        the people, he was higher than any of the people from his
        shoulders and upward.

010:024 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD
        hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?
        And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.

010:025 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and
        wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel
        sent all the people away, every man to his house.

010:026 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a
        band of men, whose hearts God had touched.

010:027 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?
        And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held
        his peace.

011:001 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against
        Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make
        a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.

011:002 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will
        I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your
        right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.

011:003 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days'
        respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of
        Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come
        out to thee.

011:004 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the
        tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted
        up their voices, and wept.

011:005 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and
        Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they
        told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.

011:006 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those
        tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.

011:007 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent
        them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of
        messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and
        after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear
        of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one
        consent.

011:008 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel
        were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty
        thousand.

011:009 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say
        unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun
        be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed
        it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.

011:010 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
        unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto
        you.

011:011 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
        companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the
        morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the
        day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were
        scattered, so that two of them were not left together.

011:012 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall
        Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to
        death.

011:013 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:
        for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.

011:014 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
        and renew the kingdom there.

011:015 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul
        king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed
        sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul
        and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

012:001 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto
        your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king
        over you.

012:002 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and
        grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have
        walked before you from my childhood unto this day.

012:003 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and
        before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have
        I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or
        of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes
        therewith? and I will restore it you.

012:004 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
        neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.

012:005 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and
        his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought
        in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.

012:006 And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced
        Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the
        land of Egypt.

012:007 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before
        the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did
        to you and to your fathers.

012:008 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto
        the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought
        forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this
        place.

012:009 And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the
        hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the
        hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of
        Moab, and they fought against them.

012:010 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned,
        because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and
        Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies,
        and we will serve thee.

012:011 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and
        Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on
        every side, and ye dwelled safe.

012:012 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
        came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign
        over us: when the LORD your God was your king.

012:013 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye
        have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.

012:014 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice,
        and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall
        both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue
        following the LORD your God:

012:015 But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel
        against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of
        the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.

012:016 Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD
        will do before your eyes.

012:017 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and
        he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see
        that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight
        of the LORD, in asking you a king.

012:018 So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and
        rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and
        Samuel.

012:019 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants
        unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto
        all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.

012:020 And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all
        this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD,
        but serve the LORD with all your heart;

012:021 And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain
        things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.

012:022 For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's
        sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.

012:023 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the
        LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good
        and the right way:

012:024 Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your
        heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.

012:025 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both
        ye and your king.

013:001 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
        Israel,

013:002 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two
        thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a
        thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the
        rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.

013:003 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in
        Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the
        trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

013:004 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of
        the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination
        with the Philistines. And the people were called together
        after Saul to Gilgal.

013:005 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
        Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen,
        and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude:
        and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from
        Bethaven.

013:006 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for
        the people were distressed,) then the people did hide
        themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in
        high places, and in pits.

013:007 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad
        and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the
        people followed him trembling.

013:008 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that
        Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the
        people were scattered from him.

013:009 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
        offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.

013:010 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
        offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul
        went out to meet him, that he might salute him.

013:011 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I
        saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou
        camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines
        gathered themselves together at Michmash;

013:012 Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me
        to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I
        forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.

013:013 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast
        not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he
        commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy
        kingdom upon Israel for ever.

013:014 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought
        him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him
        to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that
        which the LORD commanded thee.

013:015 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
        Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with
        him, about six hundred men.

013:016 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were
        present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the
        Philistines encamped in Michmash.

013:017 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
        three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth
        to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:

013:018 And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another
        company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the
        valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

013:019 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of
        Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them
        swords or spears:

013:020 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to
        sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and
        his mattock.

013:021 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters,
        and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.

013:022 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was
        neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people
        that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with
        Jonathan his son was there found.

013:023 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
        Michmash.

014:001 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
        said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us
        go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other
        side. But he told not his father.

014:002 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
        pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were
        with him were about six hundred men;

014:003 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of
        Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing
        an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.

014:004 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
        unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the
        one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of
        the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.

014:005 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
        Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.

014:006 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
        and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised:
        it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no
        restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.

014:007 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine
        heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy
        heart.

014:008 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men,
        and we will discover ourselves unto them.

014:009 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
        will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.

014:010 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for
        the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be
        a sign unto us.

014:011 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of
        the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews
        come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

014:012 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
        armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a
        thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after
        me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.

014:013 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and
        his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and
        his armourbearer slew after him.

014:014 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer
        made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of
        land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.

014:015 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among
        all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also
        trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great
        trembling.

014:016 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
        behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating
        down one another.

014:017 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,
        and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered,
        behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.

014:018 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
        ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.

014:019 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that
        the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and
        increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.

014:020 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
        themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every
        man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great
        discomfiture.

014:021 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before
        that time, which went up with them into the camp from the
        country round about, even they also turned to be with the
        Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.

014:022 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in
        mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even
        they also followed hard after them in the battle.

014:023 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over
        unto Bethaven.

014:024 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had
        adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any
        food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So
        none of the people tasted any food.

014:025 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey
        upon the ground.

014:026 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
        dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people
        feared the oath.

014:027 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
        the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was
        in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand
        to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.

014:028 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
        charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man
        that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.

014:029 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I
        pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I
        tasted a little of this honey.

014:030 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
        the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not
        been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?

014:031 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to
        Aijalon: and the people were very faint.

014:032 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
        and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did
        eat them with the blood.

014:033 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against
        the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye
        have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.

014:034 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
        unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his
        sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the
        LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought
        every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.

014:035 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first
        altar that he built unto the LORD.

014:036 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
        and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a
        man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto
        thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.

014:037 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
        Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?
        But he answered him not that day.

014:038 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the
        people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.

014:039 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
        Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man
        among all the people that answered him.

014:040 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
        Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said
        unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.

014:041 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a
        perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people
        escaped.

014:042 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
        Jonathan was taken.

014:043 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
        Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey
        with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must
        die.

014:044 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt
        surely die, Jonathan.

014:045 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
        wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the
        LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the
        ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people
        rescued Jonathan, that he died not.

014:046 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
        Philistines went to their own place.

014:047 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all
        his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the
        children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of
        Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he
        turned himself, he vexed them.

014:048 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and
        delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

014:049 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
        and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the
        firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:

014:050 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of
        Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner,
        the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.

014:051 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner
        was the son of Abiel.

014:052 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of
        Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he
        took him unto him.

015:001 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to
        be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken
        thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.

015:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did
        to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came
        up from Egypt.

015:003 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they
        have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant
        and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

015:004 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
        Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of
        Judah.

015:005 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the
        valley.

015:006 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
        among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye
        shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came
        up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the
        Amalekites.

015:007 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest
        to Shur, that is over against Egypt.

015:008 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
        destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

015:009 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the
        sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs,
        and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but
        every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed
        utterly.

015:010 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,

015:011 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is
        turned back from following me, and hath not performed my
        commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the
        LORD all night.

015:012 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was
        told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set
        him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone
        down to Gilgal.

015:013 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be
        thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the
        LORD.

015:014 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep
        in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

015:015 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for
        the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to
        sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly
        destroyed.

015:016 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what
        the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say
        on.

015:017 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight,
        wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the
        LORD anointed thee king over Israel?

015:018 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly
        destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them
        until they be consumed.

015:019 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but
        didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the
        LORD?

015:020 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
        LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have
        brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed
        the Amalekites.

015:021 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of
        the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to
        sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.

015:022 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt
        offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD?
        Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than
        the fat of rams.

015:023 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
        as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word
        of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.

015:024 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have
        transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words:
        because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.

015:025 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with
        me, that I may worship the LORD.

015:026 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for
        thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath
        rejected thee from being king over Israel.

015:027 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
        skirt of his mantle, and it rent.

015:028 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of
        Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of
        thine, that is better than thou.

015:029 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for
        he is not a man, that he should repent.

015:030 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,
        before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn
        again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.

015:031 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the
        LORD.

015:032 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
        Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said,
        Surely the bitterness of death is past.

015:033 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so
        shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed
        Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.

015:034 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to
        Gibeah of Saul.

015:035 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his
        death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD
        repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

016:001 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for
        Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?
        fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse
        the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his
        sons.

016:002 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill
        me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am
        come to sacrifice to the LORD.

016:003 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what
        thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name
        unto thee.

016:004 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to
        Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming,
        and said, Comest thou peaceably?

016:005 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD:
        sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he
        sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the
        sacrifice.

016:006 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
        Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.

016:007 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or
        on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for
        the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the
        outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.

016:008 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.
        And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

016:009 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath
        the LORD chosen this.

016:010 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
        Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.

016:011 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he
        said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he
        keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch
        him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.

016:012 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal
        of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the
        LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.

016:013 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the
        midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon
        David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to
        Ramah.

016:014 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
        spirit from the LORD troubled him.

016:015 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
        from God troubleth thee.

016:016 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee,
        to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it
        shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon
        thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be
        well.

016:017 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can
        play well, and bring him to me.

016:018 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have
        seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in
        playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and
        prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with
        him.

016:019 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me
        David thy son, which is with the sheep.

016:020 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,
        and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.

016:021 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him
        greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

016:022 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand
        before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

016:023 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon
        Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so
        Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed
        from him.

017:001 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle,
        and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to
        Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

017:002 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
        pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array
        against the Philistines.

017:003 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
        Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a
        valley between them.

017:004 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the
        Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six
        cubits and a span.

017:005 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed
        with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five
        thousand shekels of brass.

017:006 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of
        brass between his shoulders.

017:007 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his
        spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one
        bearing a shield went before him.

017:008 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said
        unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am
        not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man
        for you, and let him come down to me.

017:009 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we
        be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him,
        then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.

017:010 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
        give me a man, that we may fight together.

017:011 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
        they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

017:012 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,
        whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went
        among men for an old man in the days of Saul.

017:013 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to
        the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the
        battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab,
        and the third Shammah.

017:014 And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed
        Saul.

017:015 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's
        sheep at Bethlehem.

017:016 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and
        presented himself forty days.

017:017 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren
        an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run
        to the camp of thy brethren;

017:018 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their
        thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their
        pledge.

017:019 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the
        valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.

017:020 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep
        with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him;
        and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the
        fight, and shouted for the battle.

017:021 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array,
        army against army.

017:022 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
        carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his
        brethren.

017:023 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the
        champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the
        armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same
        words: and David heard them.

017:024 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from
        him, and were sore afraid.

017:025 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come
        up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that
        the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great
        riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's
        house free in Israel.

017:026 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What
        shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and
        taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this
        uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of
        the living God?

017:027 And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So
        shall it be done to the man that killeth him.

017:028 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;
        and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why
        camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those
        few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the
        naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou
        mightest see the battle.

017:029 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?

017:030 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the
        same manner: and the people answered him again after the
        former manner.

017:031 And when the words were heard which David spake, they
        rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.

017:032 And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of
        him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.

017:033 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
        Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he
        a man of war from his youth.

017:034 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep,
        and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the
        flock:

017:035 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out
        of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by
        his beard, and smote him, and slew him.

017:036 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
        uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he
        hath defied the armies of the living God.

017:037 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
        of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver
        me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto
        David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.

017:038 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of
        brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.

017:039 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to
        go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I
        cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David
        put them off him.

017:040 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
        stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag
        which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand:
        and he drew near to the Philistine.

017:041 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the
        man that bare the shield went before him.

017:042 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he
        disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a
        fair countenance.

017:043 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou
        comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by
        his gods.

017:044 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
        thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the
        field.

017:045 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
        sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee
        in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of
        Israel, whom thou hast defied.

017:046 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will
        smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the
        carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the
        fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that
        all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

017:047 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with
        sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will
        give you into our hands.

017:048 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and
        drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward
        the army to meet the Philistine.

017:049 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone,
        and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that
        the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to
        the earth.

017:050 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
        stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was
        no sword in the hand of David.

017:051 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took
        his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew
        him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines
        saw their champion was dead, they fled.

017:052 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and
        pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to
        the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell
        down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

017:053 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
        Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.

017:054 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
        Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.

017:055 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he
        said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is
        this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I
        cannot tell.

017:056 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.

017:057 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
        Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of
        the Philistine in his hand.

017:058 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And
        David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the
        Bethlehemite.

018:001 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
        Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of
        David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.

018:002 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home
        to his father's house.

018:003 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him
        as his own soul.

018:004 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him,
        and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and
        to his bow, and to his girdle.

018:005 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
        himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he
        was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the
        sight of Saul's servants.

018:006 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
        the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of
        all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul,
        with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.

018:007 And the women answered one another as they played, and said,
        Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.

018:008 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
        said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me
        they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more
        but the kingdom?

018:009 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

018:010 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from
        God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the
        house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and
        there was a javelin in Saul's hand.

018:011 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David
        even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his
        presence twice.

018:012 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him,
        and was departed from Saul.

018:013 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
        over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the
        people.

018:014 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
        was with him.

018:015 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely,
        he was afraid of him.

018:016 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and
        came in before them.

018:017 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her
        will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and
        fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be
        upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.

018:018 And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
        father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the
        king?

018:019 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter
        should have been given to David, that she was given unto
        Adriel the Meholathite to wife.

018:020 And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul,
        and the thing pleased him.

018:021 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to
        him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.
        Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in
        law in the one of the twain.

018:022 And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
        secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and
        all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in
        law.

018:023 And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David.
        And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's
        son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?

018:024 And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner
        spake David.

018:025 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth
        not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to
        be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make
        David fall by the hand of the Philistines.

018:026 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David
        well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not
        expired.

018:027 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of
        the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their
        foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that
        he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal
        his daughter to wife.

018:028 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that
        Michal Saul's daughter loved him.

018:029 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
        David's enemy continually.

018:030 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to
        pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more
        wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was
        much set by.

019:001 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,
        that they should kill David.

019:002 But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan
        told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now
        therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the
        morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:

019:003 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field
        where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and
        what I see, that I will tell thee.

019:004 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and
        said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant,
        against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and
        because his works have been to thee-ward very good:

019:005 For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine,
        and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou
        sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin
        against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?

019:006 And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware,
        As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.

019:007 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
        things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his
        presence, as in times past.

019:008 And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with
        the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and
        they fled from him.

019:009 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in
        his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with
        his hand.

019:010 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the
        javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he
        smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped
        that night.

019:011 Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him,
        and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told
        him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow
        thou shalt be slain.

019:012 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and
        fled, and escaped.

019:013 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a
        pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a
        cloth.

019:014 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is
        sick.

019:015 And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring
        him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

019:016 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an
        image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his
        bolster.

019:017 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and
        sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered
        Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?

019:018 So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and
        told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went
        and dwelt in Naioth.

019:019 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in
        Ramah.

019:020 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the
        company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as
        appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers
        of Saul, and they also prophesied.

019:021 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
        prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third
        time, and they prophesied also.

019:022 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is
        in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David?
        And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.

019:023 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God
        was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he
        came to Naioth in Ramah.

019:024 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
        Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all
        that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the
        prophets?

020:001 And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
        Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is
        my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?

020:002 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold,
        my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he
        will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from
        me? it is not so.

020:003 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly
        knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith,
        Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as
        the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step
        between me and death.

020:004 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I
        will even do it for thee.

020:005 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new
        moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but
        let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third
        day at even.

020:006 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
        leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there
        is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.

020:007 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but
        if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by
        him.

020:008 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou
        hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with
        thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me
        thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?

020:009 And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew
        certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon
        thee, then would not I tell it thee?

020:010 Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy
        father answer thee roughly?

020:011 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the
        field. And they went out both of them into the field.

020:012 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I
        have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third
        day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then
        send not unto thee, and shew it thee;

020:013 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my
        father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send
        thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with
        thee, as he hath been with my father.

020:014 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness
        of the LORD, that I die not:

020:015 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for
        ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David
        every one from the face of the earth.

020:016 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying,
        Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.

020:017 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved
        him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

020:018 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and
        thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.

020:019 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
        quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself
        when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone
        Ezel.

020:020 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I
        shot at a mark.

020:021 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the
        arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows
        are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there
        is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.

020:022 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are
        beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.

020:023 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,
        behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.

020:024 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
        come, the king sat him down to eat meat.

020:025 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a
        seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's
        side, and David's place was empty.

020:026 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he
        thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely
        he is not clean.

020:027 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of
        the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto
        Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to
        meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?

020:028 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me
        to go to Bethlehem:

020:029 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a
        sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to
        be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let
        me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he
        cometh not unto the king's table.

020:030 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
        unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I
        know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own
        confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?

020:031 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou
        shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send
        and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.

020:032 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
        Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?

020:033 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan
        knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.

020:034 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat
        no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for
        David, because his father had done him shame.

020:035 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out
        into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little
        lad with him.

020:036 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
        shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

020:037 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
        Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is
        not the arrow beyond thee?

020:038 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not.
        And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his
        master.

020:039 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew
        the matter.

020:040 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto
        him, Go, carry them to the city.

020:041 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
        toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and
        bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and
        wept one with another, until David exceeded.

020:042 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
        sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be
        between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for
        ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the
        city.

021:001 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech
        was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art
        thou alone, and no man with thee?

021:002 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath
        commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man
        know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and
        what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants
        to such and such a place.

021:003 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of
        bread in mine hand, or what there is present.

021:004 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common
        bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the
        young men have kept themselves at least from women.

021:005 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
        women have been kept from us about these three days, since I
        came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the
        bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified
        this day in the vessel.

021:006 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread
        there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD,
        to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.

021:007 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
        detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite,
        the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.

021:008 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under
        thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword
        nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required
        haste.

021:009 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom
        thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped
        in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it:
        for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is
        none like that; give it me.

021:010 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went
        to Achish the king of Gath.

021:011 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David
        the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him
        in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David
        his ten thousands?

021:012 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore
        afraid of Achish the king of Gath.

021:013 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself
        mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate,
        and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.

021:014 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
        wherefore then have ye brought him to me?

021:015 Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to
        play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into
        my house?

022:001 David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave
        Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house
        heard it, they went down thither to him.

022:002 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in
        debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves
        unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were
        with him about four hundred men.

022:003 And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the
        king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come
        forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.

022:004 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt
        with him all the while that David was in the hold.

022:005 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
        depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David
        departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.

022:006 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that
        were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in
        Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were
        standing about him;)

022:007 Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear
        now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of
        you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of
        thousands, and captains of hundreds;

022:008 That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none
        that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of
        Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or
        sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against
        me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

022:009 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the
        servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to
        Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

022:010 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals,
        and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

022:011 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
        Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in
        Nob: and they came all of them to the king.

022:012 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,
        Here I am, my lord.

022:013 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou
        and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a
        sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise
        against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

022:014 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so
        faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's
        son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in
        thine house?

022:015 Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me:
        let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all
        the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all
        this, less or more.

022:016 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and
        all thy father's house.

022:017 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,
        and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is
        with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not
        shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put
        forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.

022:018 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the
        priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the
        priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that
        did wear a linen ephod.

022:019 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of
        the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and
        oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

022:020 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
        Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.

022:021 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's
        priests.

022:022 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg
        the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have
        occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.

022:023 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
        seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

023:001 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight
        against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.

023:002 Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and
        smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and
        smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.

023:003 And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in
        Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the
        armies of the Philistines?

023:004 Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD
        answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will
        deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

023:005 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
        Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them
        with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of
        Keilah.

023:006 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled
        to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his
        hand.

023:007 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
        said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut
        in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.

023:008 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to
        Keilah, to besiege David and his men.

023:009 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against
        him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the
        ephod.

023:010 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath
        certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to
        destroy the city for my sake.

023:011 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul
        come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I
        beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will
        come down.

023:012 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men
        into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver
        thee up.

023:013 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose
        and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could
        go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah;
        and he forbare to go forth.

023:014 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and
        remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul
        sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.

023:015 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and
        David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

023:016 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the
        wood, and strengthened his hand in God.

023:017 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father
        shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I
        shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.

023:018 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode
        in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

023:019 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
        David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the
        hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?

023:020 Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire
        of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him
        into the king's hand.

023:021 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have
        compassion on me.

023:022 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where
        his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me
        that he dealeth very subtilly.

023:023 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
        where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the
        certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass,
        if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout
        all the thousands of Judah.

023:024 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and
        his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the
        south of Jeshimon.

023:025 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;
        wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the
        wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after
        David in the wilderness of Maon.

023:026 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his
        men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get
        away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David
        and his men round about to take them.

023:027 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
        come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.

023:028 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
        against the Philistines: therefore they called that place
        Selahammahlekoth.

023:029 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
        Engedi.

024:001 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
        Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in
        the wilderness of Engedi.

024:002 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel,
        and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild
        goats.

024:003 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave;
        and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men
        remained in the sides of the cave.

024:004 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which
        the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy
        into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem
        good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of
        Saul's robe privily.

024:005 And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him,
        because he had cut off Saul's skirt.

024:006 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do
        this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch
        forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the
        LORD.

024:007 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered
        them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the
        cave, and went on his way.

024:008 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and
        cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul
        looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth,
        and bowed himself.

024:009 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words,
        saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?

024:010 Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had
        delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some
        bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I
        will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the
        LORD's anointed.

024:011 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
        hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed
        thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor
        transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against
        thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.

024:012 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
        thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

024:013 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth
        from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

024:014 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost
        thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.

024:015 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee,
        and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.

024:016 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
        these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my
        son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

024:017 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou
        hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

024:018 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well
        with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into
        thine hand, thou killedst me not.

024:019 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
        wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done
        unto me this day.

024:020 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king,
        and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine
        hand.

024:021 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not
        cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my
        name out of my father's house.

024:022 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and
        his men gat them up unto the hold.

025:001 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered
        together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at
        Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of
        Paran.

025:002 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
        and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep,
        and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

025:003 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife
        Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a
        beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in
        his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.

025:004 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his
        sheep.

025:005 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the
        young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet
        him in my name:

025:006 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace
        be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be
        unto all that thou hast.

025:007 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy
        shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was
        there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in
        Carmel.

025:008 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the
        young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good
        day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto
        thy servants, and to thy son David.

025:009 And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according
        to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.

025:010 And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David?
        and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days
        that break away every man from his master.

025:011 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I
        have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know
        not whence they be?

025:012 So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and
        came and told him all those sayings.

025:013 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword.
        And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded
        on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred
        men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.

025:014 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying,
        Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute
        our master; and he railed on them.

025:015 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,
        neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant
        with them, when we were in the fields:

025:016 They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while
        we were with them keeping the sheep.

025:017 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
        determined against our master, and against all his household:
        for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to
        him.

025:018 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two
        bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five
        measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins,
        and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.

025:019 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I
        come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.

025:020 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by
        the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came
        down against her; and she met them.

025:021 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
        fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of
        all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for
        good.

025:022 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave
        of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that
        pisseth against the wall.

025:023 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the
        ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to
        the ground,

025:024 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let
        this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
        in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.

025:025 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even
        Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and
        folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men
        of my lord, whom thou didst send.

025:026 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
        liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to
        shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now
        let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as
        Nabal.

025:027 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto
        my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow
        my lord.

025:028 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the
        LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord
        fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found
        in thee all thy days.

025:029 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but
        the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with
        the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall
        he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.

025:030 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my
        lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning
        thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;

025:031 That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart
        unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or
        that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall
        have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.

025:032 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
        which sent thee this day to meet me:

025:033 And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast
        kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging
        myself with mine own hand.

025:034 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath
        kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and
        come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by
        the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.

025:035 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,
        and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have
        hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.

025:036 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
        house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry
        within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him
        nothing, less or more, until the morning light.

025:037 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out
        of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his
        heart died within him, and he became as a stone.

025:038 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote
        Nabal, that he died.

025:039 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be
        the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the
        hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the
        LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head.
        And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him
        to wife.

025:040 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
        they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take
        thee to him to wife.

025:041 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and
        said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet
        of the servants of my lord.

025:042 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five
        damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the
        messengers of David, and became his wife.

025:043 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of
        them his wives.

025:044 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to
        Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

026:001 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
        David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
        Jeshimon?

026:002 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
        having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek
        David in the wilderness of Ziph.

026:003 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
        Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and
        he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

026:004 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was
        come in very deed.

026:005 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:
        and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son
        of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench,
        and the people pitched round about him.

026:006 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
        Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will
        go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will
        go down with thee.

026:007 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,
        Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in
        the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round
        about him.

026:008 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy
        into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I
        pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I
        will not smite him the second time.

026:009 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can
        stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be
        guiltless?

026:010 David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall
        smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend
        into battle, and perish.

026:011 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against
        the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear
        that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.

026:012 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's
        bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew
        it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep
        sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.

026:013 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top
        of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:

026:014 And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
        saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and
        said, Who art thou that criest to the king?

026:015 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who
        is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept
        thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to
        destroy the king thy lord.

026:016 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD
        liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your
        master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's
        spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.

026:017 And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my
        son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.

026:018 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
        servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?

026:019 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the
        words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against
        me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of
        men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me
        out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD,
        saying, Go, serve other gods.

026:020 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the
        face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a
        flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

026:021 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I
        will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in
        thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have
        erred exceedingly.

026:022 And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let
        one of the young men come over and fetch it.

026:023 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his
        faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day,
        but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's
        anointed.

026:024 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine
        eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD,
        and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.

026:025 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou
        shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So
        David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

027:001 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the
        hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I
        should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and
        Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of
        Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.

027:002 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men
        that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of
        Gath.

027:003 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
        with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the
        Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

027:004 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he
        sought no more again for him.

027:005 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine
        eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country,
        that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in
        the royal city with thee?

027:006 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag
        pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.

027:007 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the
        Philistines was a full year and four months.

027:008 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and
        the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of
        old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even
        unto the land of Egypt.

027:009 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman
        alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses,
        and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to
        Achish.

027:010 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David
        said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the
        Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.

027:011 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings
        to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did
        David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in
        the country of the Philistines.

027:012 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people
        Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant
        for ever.

028:001 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines
        gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with
        Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that
        thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.

028:002 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy
        servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I
        make thee keeper of mine head for ever.

028:003 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and
        buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put
        away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of
        the land.

028:004 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
        pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and
        they pitched in Gilboa.

028:005 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid,
        and his heart greatly trembled.

028:006 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,
        neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

028:007 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
        familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And
        his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a
        familiar spirit at Endor.

028:008 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
        went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by
        night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the
        familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto
        thee.

028:009 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul
        hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar
        spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then
        layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?

028:010 And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth,
        there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.

028:011 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
        said, Bring me up Samuel.

028:012 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice:
        and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived
        me? for thou art Saul.

028:013 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest
        thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out
        of the earth.

028:014 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old
        man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul
        perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to
        the ground, and bowed himself.

028:015 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring
        me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the
        Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me,
        and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:
        therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto
        me what I shall do.

028:016 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing
        the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?

028:017 And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD
        hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy
        neighbour, even to David:

028:018 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor
        executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the
        LORD done this thing unto thee this day.

028:019 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the
        hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons
        be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel
        into the hand of the Philistines.

028:020 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was
        sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no
        strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor
        all the night.

028:021 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore
        troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath
        obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have
        hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.

028:022 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice
        of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before
        thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest
        on thy way.

028:023 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,
        together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto
        their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.

028:024 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
        killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake
        unleavened bread thereof:

028:025 And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and
        they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

029:001 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to
        Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in
        Jezreel.

029:002 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
        thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward
        with Achish.

029:003 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these
        Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the
        Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king
        of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years,
        and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto
        this day?

029:004 And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and
        the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow
        return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast
        appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest
        in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should
        he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with
        the heads of these men?

029:005 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,
        saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

029:006 Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the
        LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy
        coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have
        not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me
        unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.

029:007 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not
        the lords of the Philistines.

029:008 And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what
        hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with
        thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the
        enemies of my lord the king?

029:009 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art
        good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the
        princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with
        us to the battle.

029:010 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's
        servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up
        early in the morning, and have light, depart.

029:011 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning,
        to return into the land of the Philistines. And the
        Philistines went up to Jezreel.

030:001 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to
        Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the
        south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with
        fire;

030:002 And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew
        not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and
        went on their way.

030:003 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was
        burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their
        daughters, were taken captives.

030:004 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their
        voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

030:005 And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
        Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

030:006 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of
        stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved,
        every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David
        encouraged himself in the LORD his God.

030:007 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray
        thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither
        the ephod to David.

030:008 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after
        this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him,
        Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail
        recover all.

030:009 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him,
        and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind
        stayed.

030:010 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
        abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over
        the brook Besor.

030:011 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
        David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him
        drink water;

030:012 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters
        of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to
        him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three
        days and three nights.

030:013 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence
        art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to
        an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone
        I fell sick.

030:014 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and
        upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of
        Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.

030:015 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this
        company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt
        neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master,
        and I will bring thee down to this company.

030:016 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread
        abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing,
        because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the
        land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

030:017 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening
        of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save
        four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.

030:018 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:
        and David rescued his two wives.

030:019 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor
        great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any
        thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.

030:020 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave
        before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.

030:021 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint
        that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to
        abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David,
        and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came
        near to the people, he saluted them.

030:022 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those
        that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us,
        we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have
        recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that
        they may lead them away, and depart.

030:023 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that
        which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and
        delivered the company that came against us into our hand.

030:024 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part
        is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that
        tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.

030:025 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
        and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.

030:026 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
        elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present
        for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;

030:027 To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south
        Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,

030:028 And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in
        Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,

030:029 And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in
        the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the
        cities of the Kenites,

030:030 And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in
        Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,

030:031 And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where
        David himself and his men were wont to haunt.

031:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of
        Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
        in mount Gilboa.

031:002 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
        and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
        Melchishua, Saul's sons.

031:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
        him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.

031:004 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and
        thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and
        thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would
        not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and
        fell upon it.

031:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
        likewise upon his sword, and died with him.

031:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and
        all his men, that same day together.

031:007 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
        valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that
        the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
        they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came
        and dwelt in them.

031:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
        to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons
        fallen in mount Gilboa.

031:009 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and
        sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish
        it in the house of their idols, and among the people.

031:010 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they
        fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.

031:011 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which
        the Philistines had done to Saul;

031:012 All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the
        body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of
        Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.

031:013 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at
        Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

Book 10	2 Samuel

001:001 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
        returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had
        abode two days in Ziklag;

001:002 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man
        came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and
        earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David,
        that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

001:003 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said
        unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

001:004 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee,
        tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the
        battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and
        Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

001:005 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest
        thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

001:006 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance
        upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and,
        lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

001:007 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.
        And I answered, Here am I.

001:008 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
        Amalekite.

001:009 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay
        me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole
        in me.

001:010 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he
        could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown
        that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm,
        and have brought them hither unto my lord.

001:011 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and
        likewise all the men that were with him:

001:012 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
        and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and
        for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the
        sword.

001:013 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art
        thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an
        Amalekite.

001:014 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
        forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?

001:015 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and
        fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.

001:016 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
        mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the
        LORD's anointed.

001:017 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
        Jonathan his son:

001:018 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the
        bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)

001:019 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are
        the mighty fallen!

001:020 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon;
        lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the
        daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

001:021 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there
        be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the
        shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,
        as though he had not been anointed with oil.

001:022 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the
        bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul
        returned not empty.

001:023 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and
        in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than
        eagles, they were stronger than lions.

001:024 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
        scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold
        upon your apparel.

001:025 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O
        Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.

001:026 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant
        hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing
        the love of women.

001:027 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

002:001 And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the
        LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?
        And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither
        shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.

002:002 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
        Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

002:003 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man
        with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

002:004 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king
        over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the
        men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.

002:005 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and
        said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed
        this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried
        him.

002:006 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also
        will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this
        thing.

002:007 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye
        valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of
        Judah have anointed me king over them.

002:008 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took
        Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;

002:009 And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and
        over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over
        all Israel.

002:010 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to
        reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of
        Judah followed David.

002:011 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of
        Judah was seven years and six months.

002:012 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the
        son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

002:013 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went
        out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat
        down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on
        the other side of the pool.

002:014 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
        before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

002:015 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,
        which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of
        the servants of David.

002:016 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust
        his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together:
        wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in
        Gibeon.

002:017 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was
        beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.

002:018 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
        and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

002:019 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to
        the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

002:020 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And
        he answered, I am.

002:021 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to
        thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take
        thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from
        following of him.

002:022 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
        me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then
        should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?

002:023 Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the
        hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that
        the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and
        died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as
        came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

002:024 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went
        down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth
        before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

002:025 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
        after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an
        hill.

002:026 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour
        for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the
        latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people
        return from following their brethren?

002:027 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely
        then in the morning the people had gone up every one from
        following his brother.

002:028 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
        pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.

002:029 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
        and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they
        came to Mahanaim.

002:030 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had
        gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's
        servants nineteen men and Asahel.

002:031 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of
        Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.

002:032 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of
        his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went
        all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.

003:001 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house
        of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house
        of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.

003:002 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was
        Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

003:003 And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the
        Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the
        daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;

003:004 And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
        Shephatiah the son of Abital;

003:005 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born
        to David in Hebron.

003:006 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of
        Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong
        for the house of Saul.

003:007 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter
        of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou
        gone in unto my father's concubine?

003:008 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and
        said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness
        this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,
        and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand
        of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning
        this woman?

003:009 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath
        sworn to David, even so I do to him;

003:010 To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up
        the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even
        to Beersheba.

003:011 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared
        him.

003:012 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying,
        Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and,
        behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel
        unto thee.

003:013 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one
        thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face,
        except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou
        comest to see my face.

003:014 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,
        Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an
        hundred foreskins of the Philistines.

003:015 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
        Phaltiel the son of Laish.

003:016 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
        Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he
        returned.

003:017 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,
        Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:

003:018 Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By
        the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out
        of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all
        their enemies.

003:019 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went
        also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed
        good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of
        Benjamin.

003:020 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And
        David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.

003:021 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will
        gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a
        league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that
        thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went
        in peace.

003:022 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing
        a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was
        not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was
        gone in peace.

003:023 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they
        told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and
        he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.

003:024 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
        behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent
        him away, and he is quite gone?

003:025 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive
        thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know
        all that thou doest.

003:026 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
        after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah:
        but David knew it not.

003:027 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in
        the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under
        the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his
        brother.

003:028 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom
        are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner
        the son of Ner:

003:029 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's
        house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that
        hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff,
        or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.

003:030 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had
        slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

003:031 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with
        him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn
        before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.

003:032 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
        voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people
        wept.

003:033 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a
        fool dieth?

003:034 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a
        man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the
        people wept again over him.

003:035 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while
        it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more
        also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

003:036 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
        whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

003:037 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it
        was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

003:038 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is
        a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?

003:039 And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men
        the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward
        the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

004:001 And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his
        hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

004:002 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the
        name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,
        the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin:
        (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.

004:003 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there
        until this day.)

004:004 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.
        He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and
        Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled:
        and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,
        and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.

004:005 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,
        went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of
        Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.

004:006 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though
        they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the
        fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

004:007 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
        bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded
        him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain
        all night.

004:008 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron,
        and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of
        Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath
        avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.

004:009 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of
        Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth,
        who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,

004:010 When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to
        have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in
        Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for
        his tidings:

004:011 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
        in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now
        require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the
        earth?

004:012 And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut
        off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the
        pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and
        buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

005:001 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
        spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

005:002 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he
        that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said
        to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a
        captain over Israel.

005:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and
        king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD:
        and they anointed David king over Israel.

005:004 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned forty years.

005:005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months:
        and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all
        Israel and Judah.

005:006 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites,
        the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying,
        Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not
        come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.

005:007 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is
        the city of David.

005:008 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the
        gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind
        that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain.
        Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come
        into the house.

005:009 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.
        And David built round about from Millo and inward.

005:010 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts
        was with him.

005:011 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar
        trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an
        house.

005:012 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king
        over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his
        people Israel's sake.

005:013 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
        after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and
        daughters born to David.

005:014 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
        Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

005:015 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

005:016 And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.

005:017 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David
        king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David;
        and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.

005:018 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley
        of Rephaim.

005:019 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
        Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the
        LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the
        Philistines into thine hand.

005:020 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and
        said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me,
        as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that
        place Baalperazim.

005:021 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned
        them.

005:022 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves
        in the valley of Rephaim.

005:023 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not
        go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them
        over against the mulberry trees.

005:024 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the
        tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir
        thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite
        the host of the Philistines.

005:025 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
        Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.

006:001 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
        thirty thousand.

006:002 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with
        him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of
        God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts
        that dwelleth between the cherubims.

006:003 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it
        out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and
        Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.

006:004 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at
        Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the
        ark.

006:005 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD
        on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps,
        and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on
        cymbals.

006:006 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth
        his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen
        shook it.

006:007 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God
        smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of
        God.

006:008 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
        upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to
        this day.

006:009 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall
        the ark of the LORD come to me?

006:010 So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into
        the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house
        of Obededom the Gittite.

006:011 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
        Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all
        his household.

006:012 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the
        house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because
        of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God
        from the house of Obededom into the city of David with
        gladness.

006:013 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD
        had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

006:014 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David
        was girded with a linen ephod.

006:015 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the
        LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

006:016 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal
        Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David
        leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in
        her heart.

006:017 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his
        place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched
        for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
        before the LORD.

006:018 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt
        offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the
        name of the LORD of hosts.

006:019 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole
        multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one
        a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of
        wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.

006:020 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
        daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How
        glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself
        to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of
        the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!

006:021 And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which
        chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to
        appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:
        therefore will I play before the LORD.

006:022 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in
        mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken
        of, of them shall I be had in honour.

006:023 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the
        day of her death.

007:001 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the
        LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;

007:002 That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell
        in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within
        curtains.

007:003 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine
        heart; for the LORD is with thee.

007:004 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
        unto Nathan, saying,

007:005 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou
        build me an house for me to dwell in?

007:006 Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I
        brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this
        day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.

007:007 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children
        of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,
        whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build
        ye not me an house of cedar?

007:008 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
        saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from
        following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:

007:009 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut
        off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a
        great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in
        the earth.

007:010 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
        plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and
        move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict
        them any more, as beforetime,

007:011 And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
        people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine
        enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an
        house.

007:012 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
        fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall
        proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

007:013 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the
        throne of his kingdom for ever.

007:014 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit
        iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the
        stripes of the children of men:

007:015 But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from
        Saul, whom I put away before thee.

007:016 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
        before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.

007:017 According to all these words, and according to all this
        vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

007:018 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
        Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast
        brought me hitherto?

007:019 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but
        thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while
        to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?

007:020 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD,
        knowest thy servant.

007:021 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast
        thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know
        them.

007:022 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like
        thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all
        that we have heard with our ears.

007:023 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
        Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and
        to make him a name, and to do for you great things and
        terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou
        redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their
        gods?

007:024 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a
        people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their
        God.

007:025 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
        thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever,
        and do as thou hast said.

007:026 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of
        hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant
        David be established before thee.

007:027 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
        servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath
        thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

007:028 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
        and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

007:029 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy
        servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou,
        O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the
        house of thy servant be blessed for ever.

008:001 And after this it came to pass that David smote the
        Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out
        of the hand of the Philistines.

008:002 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
        down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to
        death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the
        Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.

008:003 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
        as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

008:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
        horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all
        the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred
        chariots.

008:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer
        king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty
        thousand men.

008:006 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
        became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD
        preserved David whithersoever he went.

008:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
        of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

008:008 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king
        David took exceeding much brass.

008:009 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the
        host of Hadadezer,

008:010 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him,
        and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and
        smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram
        brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and
        vessels of brass:

008:011 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the
        silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he
        subdued;

008:012 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of
        the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer,
        son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

008:013 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
        Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.

008:014 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
        garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And
        the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

008:015 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment
        and justice unto all his people.

008:016 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud was recorder;

008:017 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of
        Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;

008:018 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites
        and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

009:001 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of
        Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?

009:002 And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was
        Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said
        unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.

009:003 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul,
        that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said
        unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his
        feet.

009:004 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto
        the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of
        Ammiel, in Lodebar.

009:005 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of
        Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.

009:006 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
        was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.
        And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy
        servant!

009:007 And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee
        kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee
        all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at
        my table continually.

009:008 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou
        shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?

009:009 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto
        him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to
        Saul and to all his house.

009:010 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the
        land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy
        master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy
        master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had
        fifteen sons and twenty servants.

009:011 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord
        the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do.
        As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table,
        as one of the king's sons.

009:012 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And
        all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto
        Mephibosheth.

009:013 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually
        at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

010:001 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children
        of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

010:002 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
        Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent
        to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And
        David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.

010:003 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
        lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he
        hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his
        servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and
        to overthrow it?

010:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one
        half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the
        middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.

010:005 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because
        the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at
        Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.

010:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before
        David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of
        Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen,
        and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve
        thousand men.

010:007 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of
        the mighty men.

010:008 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
        array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba,
        and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in
        the field.

010:009 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him
        before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel,
        and put them in array against the Syrians:

010:010 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of
        Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against
        the children of Ammon.

010:011 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
        shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
        thee, then I will come and help thee.

010:012 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people,
        and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which
        seemeth him good.

010:013 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto
        the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.

010:014 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
        then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city.
        So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to
        Jerusalem.

010:015 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,
        they gathered themselves together.

010:016 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were
        beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the
        captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

010:017 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together,
        and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set
        themselves in array against David, and fought with him.

010:018 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of
        seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand
        horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who
        died there.

010:019 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw
        that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with
        Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the
        children of Ammon any more.

011:001 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time
        when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his
        servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the
        children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried
        still at Jerusalem.

011:002 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from
        off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and
        from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman
        was very beautiful to look upon.

011:003 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is
        not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah
        the Hittite?

011:004 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
        him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her
        uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.

011:005 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I
        am with child.

011:006 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And
        Joab sent Uriah to David.

011:007 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how
        Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.

011:008 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy
        feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there
        followed him a mess of meat from the king.

011:009 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the
        servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.

011:010 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto
        his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy
        journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?

011:011 And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,
        abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,
        are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine
        house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou
        livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.

011:012 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow
        I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day,
        and the morrow.

011:013 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before
        him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on
        his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to
        his house.

011:014 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter
        to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

011:015 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the
        forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that
        he may be smitten, and die.

011:016 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
        assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men
        were.

011:017 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and
        there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and
        Uriah the Hittite died also.

011:018 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the
        war;

011:019 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end
        of telling the matters of the war unto the king,

011:020 And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto
        thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye
        did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?

011:021 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman
        cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he
        died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy
        servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

011:022 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab
        had sent him for.

011:023 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
        against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were
        upon them even unto the entering of the gate.

011:024 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and
        some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the
        Hittite is dead also.

011:025 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
        Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword
        devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong
        against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.

011:026 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
        dead, she mourned for her husband.

011:027 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to
        his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But
        the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

012:001 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and
        said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich,
        and the other poor.

012:002 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:

012:003 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which
        he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with
        him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and
        drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him
        as a daughter.

012:004 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to
        take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the
        wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's
        lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.

012:005 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
        said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done
        this thing shall surely die:

012:006 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this
        thing, and because he had no pity.

012:007 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the
        LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I
        delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;

012:008 And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives
        into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of
        Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have
        given unto thee such and such things.

012:009 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to
        do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with
        the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast
        slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.

012:010 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
        because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of
        Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.

012:011 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee
        out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine
        eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with
        thy wives in the sight of this sun.

012:012 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before
        all Israel, and before the sun.

012:013 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD.
        And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy
        sin; thou shalt not die.

012:014 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion
        to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that
        is born unto thee shall surely die.

012:015 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the
        child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.

012:016 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,
        and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

012:017 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise
        him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat
        bread with them.

012:018 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.
        And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child
        was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet
        alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our
        voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the
        child is dead?

012:019 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David
        perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto
        his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.

012:020 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
        himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of
        the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and
        when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.

012:021 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou
        hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it
        was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and
        eat bread.

012:022 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
        for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me,
        that the child may live?

012:023 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him
        back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.

012:024 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
        and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name
        Solomon: and the LORD loved him.

012:025 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called
        his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.

012:026 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and
        took the royal city.

012:027 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
        against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

012:028 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and
        encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city,
        and it be called after my name.

012:029 And David gathered all the people together, and went to
        Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.

012:030 And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight
        whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it
        was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the
        city in great abundance.

012:031 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put
        them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of
        iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did
        he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and
        all the people returned unto Jerusalem.

013:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David
        had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of
        David loved her.

013:002 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister
        Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him
        to do anything to her.

013:003 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
        Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

013:004 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean
        from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto
        him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.

013:005 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make
        thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto
        him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat,
        and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it
        at her hand.

013:006 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king
        was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee,
        let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my
        sight, that I may eat at her hand.

013:007 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother
        Amnon's house, and dress him meat.

013:008 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid
        down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in
        his sight, and did bake the cakes.

013:009 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he
        refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And
        they went out every man from him.

013:010 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber,
        that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which
        she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her
        brother.

013:011 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of
        her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

013:012 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no
        such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.

013:013 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,
        thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I
        pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me
        from thee.

013:014 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being
        stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.

013:015 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith
        he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved
        her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

013:016 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending
        me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But
        he would not hearken unto her.

013:017 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,
        Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.

013:018 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with
        such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins
        apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the
        door after her.

013:019 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of
        divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head,
        and went on crying.

013:020 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother
        been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy
        brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in
        her brother Absalom's house.

013:021 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very
        wroth.

013:022 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:
        for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister
        Tamar.

013:023 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
        sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and
        Absalom invited all the king's sons.

013:024 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy
        servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and
        his servants go with thy servant.

013:025 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now
        go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him:
        howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.

013:026 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon
        go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with
        thee?

013:027 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's
        sons go with him.

013:028 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now
        when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto
        you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I
        commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.

013:029 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
        commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat
        him up upon his mule, and fled.

013:030 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings
        came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons,
        and there is not one of them left.

013:031 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the
        earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

013:032 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and
        said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the
        young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the
        appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day
        that he forced his sister Tamar.

013:033 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
        heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon
        only is dead.

013:034 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
        up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people
        by the way of the hill side behind him.

013:035 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come:
        as thy servant said, so it is.

013:036 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of
        speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up
        their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants
        wept very sore.

013:037 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king
        of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.

013:038 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three
        years.

013:039 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom:
        for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

014:001 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart
        was toward Absalom.

014:002 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
        said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and
        put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil,
        but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:

014:003 And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So
        Joab put the words in her mouth.

014:004 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on
        her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O
        king.

014:005 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she
        answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.

014:006 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in
        the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote
        the other, and slew him.

014:007 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,
        and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may
        kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we
        will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal
        which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name
        nor remainder upon the earth.

014:008 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I
        will give charge concerning thee.

014:009 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king,
        the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king
        and his throne be guiltless.

014:010 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to
        me, and he shall not touch thee any more.

014:011 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy
        God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to
        destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As
        the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to
        the earth.

014:012 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
        one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

014:013 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a
        thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this
        thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch
        home again his banished.

014:014 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,
        which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect
        any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not
        expelled from him.

014:015 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my
        lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid:
        and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may
        be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.

014:016 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the
        hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out
        of the inheritance of God.

014:017 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall
        now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the
        king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will
        be with thee.

014:018 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from
        me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the
        woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.

014:019 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all
        this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my
        lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left
        from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant
        Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of
        thine handmaid:

014:020 To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done
        this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an
        angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.

014:021 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this
        thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.

014:022 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself,
        and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant
        knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king,
        in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.

014:023 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to
        Jerusalem.

014:024 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him
        not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw
        not the king's face.

014:025 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as
        Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the
        crown of his head there was no blemish in him.

014:026 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end
        that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him,
        therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at
        two hundred shekels after the king's weight.

014:027 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
        whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.

014:028 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the
        king's face.

014:029 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
        but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the
        second time, he would not come.

014:030 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near
        mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And
        Absalom's servants set the field on fire.

014:031 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said
        unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?

014:032 And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying,
        Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say,
        Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to
        have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's
        face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.

014:033 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called
        for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his
        face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed
        Absalom.

015:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him
        chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

015:002 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the
        gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy
        came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him,
        and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is
        of one of the tribes of Israel.

015:003 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and
        right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.

015:004 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
        that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto
        me, and I would do him justice!

015:005 And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him
        obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed
        him.

015:006 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
        king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of
        Israel.

015:007 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto
        the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have
        vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.

015:008 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
        saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,
        then I will serve the LORD.

015:009 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went
        to Hebron.

015:010 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
        saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye
        shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

015:011 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that
        were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew
        not any thing.

015:012 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's
        counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered
        sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people
        increased continually with Absalom.

015:013 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the
        men of Israel are after Absalom.

015:014 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
        Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else
        escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us
        suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the
        edge of the sword.

015:015 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy
        servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall
        appoint.

015:016 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And
        the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the
        house.

015:017 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
        tarried in a place that was far off.

015:018 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the
        Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six
        hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before
        the king.

015:019 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
        also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king:
        for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.

015:020 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee
        go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return
        thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with
        thee.

015:021 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and
        as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the
        king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will
        thy servant be.

015:022 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the
        Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones
        that were with him.

015:023 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
        passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook
        Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the
        wilderness.

015:024 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing
        the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of
        God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done
        passing out of the city.

015:025 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into
        the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he
        will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:

015:026 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am
        I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.

015:027 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?
        return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,
        Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

015:028 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there
        come word from you to certify me.

015:029 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
        Jerusalem: and they tarried there.

015:030 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as
        he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot:
        and all the people that was with him covered every man his
        head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.

015:031 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the
        conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray
        thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.

015:032 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of
        the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite
        came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:

015:033 Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou
        shalt be a burden unto me:

015:034 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will
        be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant
        hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou
        for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.

015:035 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
        priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou
        shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to
        Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

015:036 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz
        Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall
        send unto me every thing that ye can hear.

015:037 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came
        into Jerusalem.

016:001 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,
        Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of
        asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and
        an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer
        fruits, and a bottle of wine.

016:002 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And
        Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on;
        and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and
        the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.

016:003 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba
        said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he
        said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom
        of my father.

016:004 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that
        pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech
        thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

016:005 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a
        man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei,
        the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

016:006 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king
        David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his
        right hand and on his left.

016:007 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
        bloody man, and thou man of Belial:

016:008 The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of
        Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath
        delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and,
        behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a
        bloody man.

016:009 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should
        this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray
        thee, and take off his head.

016:010 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
        Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto
        him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done
        so?

016:011 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my
        son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much
        more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him
        curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.

016:012 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that
        the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.

016:013 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on
        the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and
        threw stones at him, and cast dust.

016:014 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came
        weary, and refreshed themselves there.

016:015 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
        Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

016:016 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend,
        was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save
        the king, God save the king.

016:017 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy
        friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?

016:018 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this
        people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and
        with him will I abide.

016:019 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the
        presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's
        presence, so will I be in thy presence.

016:020 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what
        we shall do.

016:021 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's
        concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all
        Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then
        shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.

016:022 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
        Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of
        all Israel.

016:023 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
        days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so
        was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with
        Absalom.

017:001 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
        twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David
        this night:

017:002 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed,
        and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him
        shall flee; and I will smite the king only:

017:003 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom
        thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be
        in peace.

017:004 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
        Israel.

017:005 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let
        us hear likewise what he saith.

017:006 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
        saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do
        after his saying? if not; speak thou.

017:007 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
        given is not good at this time.

017:008 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that
        they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a
        bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a
        man of war, and will not lodge with the people.

017:009 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and
        it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the
        first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a
        slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.

017:010 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a
        lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy
        father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant
        men.

017:011 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto
        thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the
        sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own
        person.

017:012 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be
        found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the
        ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there
        shall not be left so much as one.

017:013 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
        bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,
        until there be not one small stone found there.

017:014 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
        Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
        For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of
        Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon
        Absalom.

017:015 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus
        and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of
        Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.

017:016 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not
        this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass
        over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that
        are with him.

017:017 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not
        be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them;
        and they went and told king David.

017:018 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went
        both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in
        Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went
        down.

017:019 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's
        mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not
        known.

017:020 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house,
        they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said
        unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they
        had sought and could not find them, they returned to
        Jerusalem.

017:021 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came
        up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said
        unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus
        hath Ahithophel counselled against you.

017:022 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and
        they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not
        one of them that was not gone over Jordan.

017:023 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
        saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to
        his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself,
        and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.

017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan,
        he and all the men of Israel with him.

017:025 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:
        which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an
        Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash,
        sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.

017:026 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

017:027 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that
        Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
        and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the
        Gileadite of Rogelim,

017:028 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and
        barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles,
        and parched pulse,

017:029 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for
        David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they
        said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the
        wilderness.

018:001 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set
        captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.

018:002 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand
        of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of
        Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of
        Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will
        surely go forth with you myself also.

018:003 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we
        flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us
        die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten
        thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour
        us out of the city.

018:004 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.
        And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came
        out by hundreds and by thousands.

018:005 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,
        Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.
        And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains
        charge concerning Absalom.

018:006 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the
        battle was in the wood of Ephraim;

018:007 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of
        David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of
        twenty thousand men.

018:008 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
        country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the
        sword devoured.

018:009 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
        mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak,
        and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up
        between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under
        him went away.

018:010 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I
        saw Absalom hanged in an oak.

018:011 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
        sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the
        ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and
        a girdle.

018:012 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
        shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine
        hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king
        charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none
        touch the young man Absalom.

018:013 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own
        life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou
        thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.

018:014 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
        three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of
        Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.

018:015 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and
        smote Absalom, and slew him.

018:016 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from
        pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

018:017 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
        wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all
        Israel fled every one to his tent.

018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for
        himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I
        have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the
        pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day,
        Absalom's place.

018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
        the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his
        enemies.

018:020 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,
        but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou
        shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.

018:021 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.
        And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
        howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab
        said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast
        no tidings ready?

018:023 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run.
        Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

018:024 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up
        to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his
        eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.

018:025 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said,
        If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came
        apace, and drew near.

018:026 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman
        called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running
        alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.

018:027 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost
        is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king
        said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

018:028 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And
        he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and
        said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the
        men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.

018:029 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
        answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy
        servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.

018:030 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
        turned aside, and stood still.

018:031 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
        king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that
        rose up against thee.

018:032 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe?
        And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all
        that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man
        is.

018:033 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over
        the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son
        Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for
        thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

019:001 And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth
        for Absalom.

019:002 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
        people: for the people heard say that day how the king was
        grieved for his son.

019:003 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as
        people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

019:004 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
        voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

019:005 And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast
        shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day
        have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy
        daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy
        concubines;

019:006 In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For
        thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither
        princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom
        had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased
        thee well.

019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
        servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there
        will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be
        worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy
        youth until now.

019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto
        all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.
        And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled
        every man to his tent.

019:009 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
        Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our
        enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the
        Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.

019:010 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
        therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?

019:011 And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,
        saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the
        last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of
        all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.

019:012 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore
        then are ye the last to bring back the king?

019:013 And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh?
        God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the
        host before me continually in the room of Joab.

019:014 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the
        heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king,
        Return thou, and all thy servants.

019:015 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
        Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over
        Jordan.

019:016 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
        hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

019:017 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
        the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
        twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the
        king.

019:018 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
        household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son
        of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;

019:019 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto
        me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did
        perversely the day that my lord the king went out of
        Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.

019:020 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore,
        behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of
        Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.

019:021 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
        Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's
        anointed?

019:022 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
        Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall
        there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I
        know that I am this day king over Israel?

019:023 Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And
        the king sware unto him.

019:024 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king,
        and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor
        washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the
        day he came again in peace.

019:025 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the
        king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou
        with me, Mephibosheth?

019:026 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for
        thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride
        thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.

019:027 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but
        my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is
        good in thine eyes.

019:028 For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord
        the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did
        eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry
        any more unto the king?

019:029 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy
        matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

019:030 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
        forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his
        own house.

019:031 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
        over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old:
        and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at
        Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.

019:033 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and
        I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

019:034 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live,
        that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?

019:035 I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between
        good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I
        drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and
        singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a
        burden unto my lord the king?

019:036 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king:
        and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?

019:037 Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die
        in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and
        of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over
        with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto
        thee.

019:038 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I
        will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and
        whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.

019:039 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was
        come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he
        returned unto his own place.

019:040 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:
        and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half
        the people of Israel.

019:041 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said
        unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen
        thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and
        all David's men with him, over Jordan?

019:042 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because
        the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for
        this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath
        he given us any gift?

019:043 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We
        have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in
        David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice
        should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the
        words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the
        men of Israel.

020:001 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was
        Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet,
        and said, We have no part in David, neither have we
        inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O
        Israel.

020:002 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed
        Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their
        king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.

020:003 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took
        the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the
        house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in
        unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death,
        living in widowhood.

020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah
        within three days, and be thou here present.

020:005 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried
        longer than the set time which he had appointed him.

020:006 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri
        do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's
        servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities,
        and escape us.

020:007 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites,
        and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out
        of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa
        went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was
        girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened
        upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it
        fell out.

020:009 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And
        Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:
        so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his
        bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.
        So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of
        Bichri.

020:011 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that
        favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after
        Joab.

020:012 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And
        when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed
        Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon
        him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.

020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on
        after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

020:014 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
        Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered
        together, and went also after him.

020:015 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and
        they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the
        trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the
        wall, to throw it down.

020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I
        pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with
        thee.

020:017 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou
        Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear
        the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.

020:018 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,
        saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they
        ended the matter.

020:019 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel:
        thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why
        wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?

020:020 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that
        I should swallow up or destroy.

020:021 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the
        son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the
        king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart
        from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head
        shall be thrown to thee over the wall.

020:022 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And
        they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it
        out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the
        city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem
        unto the king.

020:023 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son
        of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:

020:024 And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of
        Ahilud was recorder:

020:025 And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:

020:026 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

021:001 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year
        after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD
        answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he
        slew the Gibeonites.

021:002 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now
        the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the
        remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn
        unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the
        children of Israel and Judah.)

021:003 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for
        you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may
        bless the inheritance of the LORD?

021:004 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor
        gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill
        any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I
        do for you.

021:005 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
        devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining
        in any of the coasts of Israel,

021:006 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will
        hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD
        did choose. And the king said, I will give them.

021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
        of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them,
        between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.

021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
        whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five
        sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for
        Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:

021:009 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and
        they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell
        all seven together, and were put to death in the days of
        harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley
        harvest.

021:010 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
        for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until
        water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither
        the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of
        the field by night.

021:011 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
        concubine of Saul, had done.

021:012 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
        Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had
        stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines
        had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in
        Gilboa:

021:013 And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones
        of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that
        were hanged.

021:014 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
        country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his
        father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And
        after that God was intreated for the land.

021:015 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
        David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against
        the Philistines: and David waxed faint.

021:016 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight
        of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in
        weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have
        slain David.

021:017 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
        Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto
        him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that
        thou quench not the light of Israel.

021:018 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle
        with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite
        slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.

021:019 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines,
        where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the
        brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was
        like a weaver's beam.

021:020 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
        stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot
        six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to
        the giant.

021:021 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the
        brother of David slew him.

021:022 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the
        hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

022:001 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the
        day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his
        enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:

022:002 And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my
        deliverer;

022:003 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and
        the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my
        saviour; thou savest me from violence.

022:004 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall
        I be saved from mine enemies.

022:005 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly
        men made me afraid;

022:006 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death
        prevented me;

022:007 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God:
        and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did
        enter into his ears.

022:008 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
        moved and shook, because he was wroth.

022:009 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
        mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

022:010 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was
        under his feet.

022:011 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon
        the wings of the wind.

022:012 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,
        and thick clouds of the skies.

022:013 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.

022:014 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his
        voice.

022:015 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
        discomfited them.

022:016 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the
        world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the
        blast of the breath of his nostrils.

022:017 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;

022:018 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated
        me: for they were too strong for me.

022:019 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
        my stay.

022:020 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,
        because he delighted in me.

022:021 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according
        to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

022:022 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
        departed from my God.

022:023 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes,
        I did not depart from them.

022:024 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
        iniquity.

022:025 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my
        righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.

022:026 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with
        the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.

022:027 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
        froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.

022:028 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are
        upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.

022:029 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
        darkness.

022:030 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I
        leaped over a wall.

022:031 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:
        he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.

022:032 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our
        God?

022:033 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.

022:034 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my
        high places.

022:035 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken
        by mine arms.

022:036 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
        gentleness hath made me great.

022:037 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not
        slip.

022:038 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned
        not again until I had consumed them.

022:039 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could
        not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.

022:040 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that
        rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.

022:041 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I
        might destroy them that hate me.

022:042 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD,
        but he answered them not.

022:043 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did
        stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them
        abroad.

022:044 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
        thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I
        knew not shall serve me.

022:045 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they
        hear, they shall be obedient unto me.

022:046 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of
        their close places.

022:047 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the
        God of the rock of my salvation.

022:048 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people
        under me.

022:049 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast
        lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou
        hast delivered me from the violent man.

022:050 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
        heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.

022:051 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy
        to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

023:001 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse
        said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of
        the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,

023:002 The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my
        tongue.

023:003 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He
        that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.

023:004 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun
        riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass
        springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.

023:005 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me
        an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for
        this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make
        it not to grow.

023:006 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
        away, because they cannot be taken with hands:

023:007 But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and
        the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with
        fire in the same place.

023:008 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The
        Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the
        same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight
        hundred, whom he slew at one time.

023:009 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of
        the three mighty men with David, when they defied the
        Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and
        the men of Israel were gone away:

023:010 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary,
        and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a
        great victory that day; and the people returned after him only
        to spoil.

023:011 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And
        the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was
        a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from
        the Philistines.

023:012 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and
        slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.

023:013 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in
        the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of
        the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.

023:014 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the
        Philistines was then in Bethlehem.

023:015 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
        the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!

023:016 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the
        Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that
        was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:
        nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out
        unto the LORD.

023:017 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:
        is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of
        their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did
        these three mighty men.

023:018 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was
        chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three
        hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.

023:019 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their
        captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.

023:020 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
        Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of
        Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit
        in time of snow:

023:021 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a
        spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and
        plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him
        with his own spear.

023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
        among three mighty men.

023:023 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to
        the first three. And David set him over his guard.

023:024 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the
        son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

023:025 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,

023:026 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,

023:027 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,

023:028 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,

023:029 Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of
        Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,

023:030 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,

023:031 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,

023:032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,

023:033 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,

023:034 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite,
        Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,

023:035 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,

023:036 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,

023:037 Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to
        Joab the son of Zeruiah,

023:038 Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,

023:039 Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.

024:001 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,
        and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and
        Judah.

024:002 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was
        with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan
        even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know
        the number of the people.

024:003 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the
        people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the
        eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the
        king delight in this thing?

024:004 Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and
        against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of
        the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the
        people of Israel.

024:005 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the
        right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of
        Gad, and toward Jazer:

024:006 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and
        they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,

024:007 And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of
        the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the
        south of Judah, even to Beersheba.

024:008 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to
        Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.

024:009 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
        king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant
        men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five
        hundred thousand men.

024:010 And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the
        people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in
        that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away
        the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

024:011 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD
        came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,

024:012 Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three
        things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

024:013 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
        seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou
        flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue
        thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now
        advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent
        me.

024:014 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall
        now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and
        let me not fall into the hand of man.

024:015 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning
        even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from
        Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.

024:016 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
        destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the
        angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine
        hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of
        Araunah the Jebusite.

024:017 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote
        the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done
        wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine
        hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's
        house.

024:018 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear
        an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the
        Jebusite.

024:019 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD
        commanded.

024:020 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming
        on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before
        the king on his face upon the ground.

024:021 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
        servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to
        build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed
        from the people.

024:022 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and
        offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for
        burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other
        instruments of the oxen for wood.

024:023 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king.
        And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.

024:024 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it
        of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto
        the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David
        bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of
        silver.

024:025 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered
        burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated
        for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

Book 11	1 Kings

001:001 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
        him with clothes, but he gat no heat.

001:002 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for
        my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the
        king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom,
        that my lord the king may get heat.

001:003 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
        Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the
        king.

001:004 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and
        ministered to him: but the king knew her not.

001:005 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I
        will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and
        fifty men to run before him.

001:006 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
        Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and
        his mother bare him after Absalom.

001:007 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with
        Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.

001:008 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
        Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men
        which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.

001:009 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone
        of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren
        the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:

001:010 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and
        Solomon his brother, he called not.

001:011 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
        saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith
        doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?

001:012 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel,
        that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son
        Solomon.

001:013 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst
        not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying,
        Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
        sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?

001:014 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also
        will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.

001:015 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the
        king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto
        the king.

001:016 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the
        king said, What wouldest thou?

001:017 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy
        God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son
        shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.

001:018 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,
        thou knowest it not:

001:019 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance,
        and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the
        priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy
        servant hath he not called.

001:020 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon
        thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the
        throne of my lord the king after him.

001:021 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall
        sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be
        counted offenders.

001:022 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the
        prophet also came in.

001:023 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And
        when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before
        the king with his face to the ground.

001:024 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah
        shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?

001:025 For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat
        cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's
        sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest;
        and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save
        king Adonijah.

001:026 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah
        the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not
        called.

001:027 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not
        shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my
        lord the king after him?

001:028 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she
        came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.

001:029 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath
        redeemed my soul out of all distress,

001:030 Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying,
        Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
        sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do
        this day.

001:031 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did
        reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live
        for ever.

001:032 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
        prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before
        the king.

001:033 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of
        your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own
        mule, and bring him down to Gihon:

001:034 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him
        there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say,
        God save king Solomon.

001:035 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon
        my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have
        appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.

001:036 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
        Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.

001:037 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he
        with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of
        my lord king David.

001:038 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the
        son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went
        down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and
        brought him to Gihon.

001:039 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the
        tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet;
        and all the people said, God save king Solomon.

001:040 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped
        with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth
        rent with the sound of them.

001:041 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as
        they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound
        of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city
        being in an uproar?

001:042 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
        the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou
        art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.

001:043 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord
        king David hath made Solomon king.

001:044 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan
        the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the
        Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to
        ride upon the king's mule:

001:045 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
        king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so
        that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have
        heard.

001:046 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.

001:047 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king
        David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy
        name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the
        king bowed himself upon the bed.

001:048 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of
        Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day,
        mine eyes even seeing it.

001:049 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and
        rose up, and went every man his way.

001:050 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went,
        and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

001:051 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
        Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the
        altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he
        will not slay his servant with the sword.

001:052 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there
        shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness
        shall be found in him, he shall die.

001:053 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the
        altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and
        Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.

002:001 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he
        charged Solomon his son, saying,

002:002 I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and
        shew thyself a man;

002:003 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways,
        to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments,
        and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses,
        that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and
        whithersoever thou turnest thyself:

002:004 That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning
        me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk
        before me in truth with all their heart and with all their
        soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne
        of Israel.

002:005 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to
        me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of
        Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of
        Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and
        put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins,
        and in his shoes that were on his feet.

002:006 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar
        head go down to the grave in peace.

002:007 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
        and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they
        came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.

002:008 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
        Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in
        the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me
        at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not
        put thee to death with the sword.

002:009 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man,
        and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar
        head bring thou down to the grave with blood.

002:010 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
        David.

002:011 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:
        seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
        reigned he in Jerusalem.

002:012 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
        kingdom was established greatly.

002:013 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother
        of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said,
        Peaceably.

002:014 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she
        said, Say on.

002:015 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that
        all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit
        the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for
        it was his from the LORD.

002:016 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
        unto him, Say on.

002:017 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for
        he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the
        Shunammite to wife.

002:018 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.

002:019 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him
        for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed
        himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a
        seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right
        hand.

002:020 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray
        thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my
        mother: for I will not say thee nay.

002:021 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah
        thy brother to wife.

002:022 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why
        dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him
        the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him,
        and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.

002:023 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me,
        and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against
        his own life.

002:024 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me,
        and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made
        me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death
        this day.

002:025 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of
        Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.

002:026 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to
        Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death:
        but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou
        barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and
        because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was
        afflicted.

002:027 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the
        LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he
        spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

002:028 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
        though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the
        tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the
        altar.

002:029 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
        tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then
        Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall
        upon him.

002:030 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto
        him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I
        will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again,
        saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.

002:031 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
        him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent
        blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my
        father.

002:032 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who
        fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew
        them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to
        wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and
        Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.

002:033 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and
        upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon
        his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there
        be peace for ever from the LORD.

002:034 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
        slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the
        wilderness.

002:035 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over
        the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of
        Abiathar.

002:036 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
        Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not
        forth thence any whither.

002:037 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest
        over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou
        shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.

002:038 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord
        the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt
        in Jerusalem many days.

002:039 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
        servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of
        Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in
        Gath.

002:040 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to
        Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his
        servants from Gath.

002:041 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
        Gath, and was come again.

002:042 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
        Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto
        thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out,
        and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die?
        and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.

002:043 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the
        commandment that I have charged thee with?

002:044 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the
        wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to
        David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy
        wickedness upon thine own head;

002:045 And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David
        shall be established before the LORD for ever.

002:046 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
        out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was
        established in the hand of Solomon.

003:001 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
        Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David,
        until he had made an end of building his own house, and the
        house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.

003:002 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was
        no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.

003:003 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David
        his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high
        places.

003:004 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was
        the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon
        offer upon that altar.

003:005 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night:
        and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.

003:006 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my
        father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in
        truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with
        thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that
        thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this
        day.

003:007 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king
        instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I
        know not how to go out or come in.

003:008 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast
        chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted
        for multitude.

003:009 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy
        people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is
        able to judge this thy so great a people?

003:010 And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this
        thing.

003:011 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and
        hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked
        riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies;
        but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;

003:012 Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given
        thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none
        like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like
        unto thee.

003:013 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked,
        both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among
        the kings like unto thee all thy days.

003:014 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
        commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will
        lengthen thy days.

003:015 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
        Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace
        offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.

003:016 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king,
        and stood before him.

003:017 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in
        one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the
        house.

003:018 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
        that this woman was delivered also: and we were together;
        there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the
        house.

003:019 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid
        it.

003:020 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
        while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid
        her dead child in my bosom.

003:021 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold,
        it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning,
        behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.

003:022 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and
        the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy
        son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the
        king.

003:023 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,
        and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son
        is the dead, and my son is the living.

003:024 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword
        before the king.

003:025 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give
        half to the one, and half to the other.

003:026 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
        for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord,
        give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the
        other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.

003:027 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child,
        and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.

003:028 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had
        judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom
        of God was in him, to do judgment.

004:001 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.

004:002 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of
        Zadok the priest,

004:003 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud, the recorder.

004:004 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok
        and Abiathar were the priests:

004:005 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud
        the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's
        friend:

004:006 And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of
        Abda was over the tribute.

004:007 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which
        provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his
        month in a year made provision.

004:008 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:

004:009 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh,
        and Elonbethhanan:

004:010 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all
        the land of Hepher:

004:011 The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had
        Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:

004:012 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,
        and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from
        Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond
        Jokneam:

004:013 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns
        of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also
        pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore
        great cities with walls and brasen bars:

004:014 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:

004:015 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
        Solomon to wife:

004:016 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:

004:017 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:

004:018 Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:

004:019 Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the
        country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of
        Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.

004:020 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
        multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.

004:021 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
        land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they
        brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.

004:022 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of
        fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,

004:023 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an
        hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and
        fatted fowl.

004:024 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the
        river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this
        side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.

004:025 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine
        and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the
        days of Solomon.

004:026 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his
        chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.

004:027 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for
        all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his
        month: they lacked nothing.

004:028 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought
        they unto the place where the officers were, every man
        according to his charge.

004:029 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
        and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea
        shore.

004:030 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
        of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

004:031 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
        Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame
        was in all nations round about.

004:032 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
        thousand and five.

004:033 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
        even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake
        also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of
        fishes.

004:034 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
        from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

005:001 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he
        had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his
        father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.

005:002 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,

005:003 Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house
        unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were
        about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the
        soles of his feet.

005:004 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so
        that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.

005:005 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the
        LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying,
        Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall
        build an house unto my name.

005:006 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
        Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto
        thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that
        thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among
        us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.

005:007 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
        that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this
        day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great
        people.

005:008 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the
        things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy
        desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of
        fir.

005:009 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea:
        and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that
        thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged
        there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish
        my desire, in giving food for my household.

005:010 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to
        all his desire.

005:011 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
        food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus
        gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.

005:012 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and
        there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a
        league together.

005:013 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
        was thirty thousand men.

005:014 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses:
        a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and
        Adoniram was over the levy.

005:015 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,
        and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;

005:016 Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the
        work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the
        people that wrought in the work.

005:017 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
        stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

005:018 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and
        the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build
        the house.

006:001 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year
        after the children of Israel were come out of the land of
        Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in
        the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to
        build the house of the LORD.

006:002 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the
        length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof
        twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.

006:003 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits
        was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;
        and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.

006:004 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.

006:005 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round
        about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the
        temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:

006:006 The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle
        was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad:
        for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests
        round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the
        walls of the house.

006:007 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone
        made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was
        neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the
        house, while it was in building.

006:008 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the
        house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle
        chamber, and out of the middle into the third.

006:009 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house
        with beams and boards of cedar.

006:010 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits
        high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.

006:011 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,

006:012 Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt
        walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my
        commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with
        thee, which I spake unto David thy father:

006:013 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not
        forsake my people Israel.

006:014 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.

006:015 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of
        cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the
        ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and
        covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.

006:016 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the
        floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them
        for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy
        place.

006:017 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
        long.

006:018 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and
        open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.

006:019 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there
        the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

006:020 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length,
        and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height
        thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the
        altar which was of cedar.

006:021 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he
        made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and
        he overlaid it with gold.

006:022 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had
        finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the
        oracle he overlaid with gold.

006:023 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree,
        each ten cubits high.

006:024 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five
        cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part
        of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten
        cubits.

006:025 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were
        of one measure and one size.

006:026 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of
        the other cherub.

006:027 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
        stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing
        of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other
        cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one
        another in the midst of the house.

006:028 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.

006:029 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with
        carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers,
        within and without.

006:030 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
        without.

006:031 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive
        tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.

006:032 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
        carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and
        overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims,
        and upon the palm trees.

006:033 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive
        tree, a fourth part of the wall.

006:034 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one
        door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were
        folding.

006:035 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open
        flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved
        work.

006:036 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone,
        and a row of cedar beams.

006:037 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD
        laid, in the month Zif:

006:038 And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the
        eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts
        thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he
        seven years in building it.

007:001 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he
        finished all his house.

007:002 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length
        thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty
        cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows
        of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.

007:003 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay
        on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.

007:004 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against
        light in three ranks.

007:005 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and
        light was against light in three ranks.

007:006 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty
        cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch
        was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were
        before them.

007:007 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even
        the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one
        side of the floor to the other.

007:008 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the
        porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house
        for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto
        this porch.

007:009 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of
        hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from
        the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward
        the great court.

007:010 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
        stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.

007:011 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed
        stones, and cedars.

007:012 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed
        stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of
        the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.

007:013 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.

007:014 He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father
        was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with
        wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in
        brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.

007:015 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high
        apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them
        about.

007:016 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the
        tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five
        cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:

007:017 And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the
        chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for
        the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.

007:018 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one
        network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with
        pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.

007:019 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were
        of lily work in the porch, four cubits.

007:020 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also
        above, over against the belly which was by the network: and
        the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the
        other chapiter.

007:021 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he
        set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin:
        and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof
        Boaz.

007:022 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work
        of the pillars finished.

007:023 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the
        other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits:
        and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

007:024 And under the brim of it round about there were knops
        compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about:
        the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.

007:025 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
        three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
        south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set
        above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.

007:026 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was
        wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it
        contained two thousand baths.

007:027 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of
        one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three
        cubits the height of it.

007:028 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had
        borders, and the borders were between the ledges:

007:029 And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions,
        oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base
        above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions
        made of thin work.

007:030 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass:
        and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver
        were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.

007:031 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:
        but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a
        cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings
        with their borders, foursquare, not round.

007:032 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of
        the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel
        was a cubit and half a cubit.

007:033 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot
        wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes,
        and their spokes, were all molten.

007:034 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one
        base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.

007:035 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a
        cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and
        the borders thereof were of the same.

007:036 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders
        thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according
        to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.

007:037 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one
        casting, one measure, and one size.

007:038 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty
        baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of
        the ten bases one laver.

007:039 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five
        on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right
        side of the house eastward over against the south.

007:040 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So
        Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king
        Solomon for the house of the LORD:

007:041 The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were
        on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover
        the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the
        pillars;

007:042 And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two
        rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls
        of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;

007:043 And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;

007:044 And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;

007:045 And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these
        vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the
        LORD, were of bright brass.

007:046 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
        ground between Succoth and Zarthan.

007:047 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were
        exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.

007:048 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house
        of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold,
        whereupon the shewbread was,

007:049 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and
        five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the
        lamps, and the tongs of gold,

007:050 And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the
        spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold,
        both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place,
        and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.

007:051 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house
        of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his
        father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the
        vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the
        LORD.

008:001 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
        of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
        Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring
        up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of
        David, which is Zion.

008:002 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king
        Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the
        seventh month.

008:003 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the
        ark.

008:004 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of
        the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
        tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring
        up.

008:005 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that
        were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark,
        sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor
        numbered for multitude.

008:006 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy
        place, even under the wings of the cherubims.

008:007 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place
        of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
        thereof above.

008:008 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were
        seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were
        not seen without: and there they are unto this day.

008:009 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone,
        which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant
        with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of
        Egypt.

008:010 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
        holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,

008:011 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the
        cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the
        LORD.

008:012 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the
        thick darkness.

008:013 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place
        for thee to abide in for ever.

008:014 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the
        congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel
        stood;)

008:015 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake
        with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand
        fulfilled it, saying,

008:016 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of
        Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to
        build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose
        David to be over my people Israel.

008:017 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
        for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

008:018 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in
        thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well
        that it was in thine heart.

008:019 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that
        shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house
        unto my name.

008:020 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am
        risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne
        of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for
        the name of the LORD God of Israel.

008:021 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the
        covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he
        brought them out of the land of Egypt.

008:022 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence
        of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands
        toward heaven:

008:023 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in
        heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and
        mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their
        heart:

008:024 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou
        promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast
        fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.

008:025 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David
        my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not
        fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so
        that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk
        before me as thou hast walked before me.

008:026 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be
        verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.

008:027 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
        heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this
        house that I have builded?

008:028 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to
        his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
        to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:

008:029 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
        even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall
        be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy
        servant shall make toward this place.

008:030 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of
        thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and
        hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest,
        forgive.

008:031 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid
        upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine
        altar in this house:

008:032 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants,
        condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and
        justifying the righteous, to give him according to his
        righteousness.

008:033 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy,
        because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to
        thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication
        unto thee in this house:

008:034 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people
        Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest
        unto their fathers.

008:035 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
        have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and
        confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou
        afflictest them:

008:036 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants,
        and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way
        wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which
        thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.

008:037 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
        blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their
        enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever
        plague, whatsoever sickness there be;

008:038 What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by
        all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague
        of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this
        house:

008:039 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and
        do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart
        thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of
        all the children of men;)

008:040 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the
        land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

008:041 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people
        Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;

008:042 (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong
        hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and
        pray toward this house;

008:043 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to
        all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of
        the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people
        Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have
        builded, is called by thy name.

008:044 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy,
        whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the
        LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the
        house that I have built for thy name:

008:045 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication,
        and maintain their cause.

008:046 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth
        not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the
        enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of
        the enemy, far or near;

008:047 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they
        were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto
        thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying,
        We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed
        wickedness;

008:048 And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all
        their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away
        captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou
        gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen,
        and the house which I have built for thy name:

008:049 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven
        thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,

008:050 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all
        their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against
        thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them
        captive, that they may have compassion on them:

008:051 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou
        broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace
        of iron:

008:052 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy
        servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to
        hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.

008:053 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the
        earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of
        Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of
        Egypt, O LORD God.

008:054 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying
        all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from
        before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with
        his hands spread up to heaven.

008:055 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with
        a loud voice, saying,

008:056 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people
        Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not
        failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by
        the hand of Moses his servant.

008:057 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let
        him not leave us, nor forsake us:

008:058 That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his
        ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his
        judgments, which he commanded our fathers.

008:059 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication
        before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night,
        that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of
        his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:

008:060 That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is
        God, and that there is none else.

008:061 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to
        walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this
        day.

008:062 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice
        before the LORD.

008:063 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
        offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an
        hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the
        children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.

008:064 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that
        was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt
        offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace
        offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD
        was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat
        offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.

008:065 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with
        him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto
        the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and
        seven days, even fourteen days.

008:066 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed
        the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart
        for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his
        servant, and for Israel his people.

009:001 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of
        the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's
        desire which he was pleased to do,

009:002 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had
        appeared unto him at Gibeon.

009:003 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
        supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed
        this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for
        ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.

009:004 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked,
        in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to
        all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and
        my judgments:

009:005 Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel
        for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There
        shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.

009:006 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
        children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes
        which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and
        worship them:

009:007 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
        them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will
        I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a
        byword among all people:

009:008 And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it
        shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why
        hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?

009:009 And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their
        God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt,
        and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them,
        and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all
        this evil.

009:010 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon
        had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the
        king's house,

009:011 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
        trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his
        desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in
        the land of Galilee.

009:012 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon
        had given him; and they pleased him not.

009:013 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me,
        my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this
        day.

009:014 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.

009:015 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised;
        for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and
        Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and
        Gezer.

009:016 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and
        burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the
        city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's
        wife.

009:017 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,

009:018 And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,

009:019 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for
        his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which
        Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in
        all the land of his dominion.

009:020 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
        Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the
        children of Israel,

009:021 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the
        children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon
        those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.

009:022 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but
        they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and
        his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.

009:023 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's
        work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people
        that wrought in the work.

009:024 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto
        her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build
        Millo.

009:025 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings
        and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the
        LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the
        LORD. So he finished the house.

009:026 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
        beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of
        Edom.

009:027 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
        knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.

009:028 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
        hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

010:001 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
        concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with
        hard questions.

010:002 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
        that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and
        when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all
        that was in her heart.

010:003 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any
        thing hid from the king, which he told her not.

010:004 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and
        the house that he had built,

010:005 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
        and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and
        his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the
        house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.

010:006 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in
        mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.

010:007 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes
        had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom
        and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.

010:008 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand
        continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.

010:009 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set
        thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel
        for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and
        justice.

010:010 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
        and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there
        came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen
        of Sheba gave to king Solomon.

010:011 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,
        brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and
        precious stones.

010:012 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of
        the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries
        for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen
        unto this day.

010:013 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
        whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of
        his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country,
        she and her servants.

010:014 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
        six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,

010:015 Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of
        the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of
        the governors of the country.

010:016 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
        hundred shekels of gold went to one target.

010:017 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound
        of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house
        of the forest of Lebanon.

010:018 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
        it with the best gold.

010:019 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round
        behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of
        the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.

010:020 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
        upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any
        kingdom.

010:021 And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all
        the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure
        gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the
        days of Solomon.

010:022 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of
        Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish,
        bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

010:023 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches
        and for wisdom.

010:024 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which
        God had put in his heart.

010:025 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
        vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses,
        and mules, a rate year by year.

010:026 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he
        had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
        horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and
        with the king at Jerusalem.

010:027 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and
        cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the
        vale, for abundance.

010:028 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
        the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

010:029 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
        shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and
        so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of
        Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

011:001 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the
        daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites,
        Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:

011:002 Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the
        children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall
        they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your
        heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.

011:003 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
        concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

011:004 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives
        turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not
        perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his
        father.

011:005 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,
        and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

011:006 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not
        fully after the LORD, as did David his father.

011:007 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the
        abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and
        for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.

011:008 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt
        incense and sacrificed unto their gods.

011:009 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was
        turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto
        him twice,

011:010 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should
        not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD
        commanded.

011:011 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is
        done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my
        statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the
        kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.

011:012 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy
        father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.

011:013 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give
        one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for
        Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.

011:014 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
        Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.

011:015 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
        captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he
        had smitten every male in Edom;

011:016 (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until
        he had cut off every male in Edom:)

011:017 That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's
        servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little
        child.

011:018 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took
        men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto
        Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed
        him victuals, and gave him land.

011:019 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that
        he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of
        Tahpenes the queen.

011:020 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
        Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in
        Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.

011:021 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his
        fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad
        said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own
        country.

011:022 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,
        that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he
        answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.

011:023 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of
        Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:

011:024 And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band,
        when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and
        dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.

011:025 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
        beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel,
        and reigned over Syria.

011:026 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
        Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow
        woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.

011:027 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the
        king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the
        city of David his father.

011:028 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon
        seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him
        ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.

011:029 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
        Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in
        the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they
        two were alone in the field:

011:030 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it
        in twelve pieces:

011:031 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith
        the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom
        out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:

011:032 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and
        for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all
        the tribes of Israel:)

011:033 Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped
        Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the
        Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and
        have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine
        eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David
        his father.

011:034 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but
        I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my
        servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments
        and my statutes:

011:035 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will
        give it unto thee, even ten tribes.

011:036 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant
        may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which
        I have chosen me to put my name there.

011:037 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all
        that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.

011:038 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
        thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my
        sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my
        servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure
        house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.

011:039 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for
        ever.

011:040 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,
        and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in
        Egypt until the death of Solomon.

011:041 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and
        his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of
        Solomon?

011:042 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
        was forty years.

011:043 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
        of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
        stead.

012:001 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to
        Shechem to make him king.

012:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
        yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence
        of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)

012:003 That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the
        congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,

012:004 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the
        grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he
        put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.

012:005 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come
        again to me. And the people departed.

012:006 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood
        before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do
        ye advise that I may answer this people?

012:007 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant
        unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer
        them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy
        servants for ever.

012:008 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had
        given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up
        with him, and which stood before him:

012:009 And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer
        this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke
        which thy father did put upon us lighter?

012:010 And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him,
        saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto
        thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it
        lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little
        finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

012:011 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I
        will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with
        whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

012:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
        as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third
        day.

012:013 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old
        men's counsel that they gave him;

012:014 And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
        My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke:
        my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
        you with scorpions.

012:015 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the
        cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying,
        which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the
        son of Nebat.

012:016 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,
        the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in
        David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to
        your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So
        Israel departed unto their tents.

012:017 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of
        Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

012:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and
        all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore
        king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee
        to Jerusalem.

012:019 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

012:020 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was
        come again, that they sent and called him unto the
        congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was
        none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah
        only.

012:021 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the
        house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and
        fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight
        against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to
        Rehoboam the son of Solomon.

012:022 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

012:023 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and
        unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant
        of the people, saying,

012:024 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
        your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his
        house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to
        the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the
        word of the LORD.

012:025 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt
        therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.

012:026 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return
        to the house of David:

012:027 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD
        at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again
        unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they
        shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.

012:028 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,
        and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to
        Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up
        out of the land of Egypt.

012:029 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.

012:030 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship
        before the one, even unto Dan.

012:031 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the
        lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.

012:032 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
        fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in
        Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel,
        sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in
        Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.

012:033 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the
        fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he
        had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the
        children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt
        incense.

013:001 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word
        of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to
        burn incense.

013:002 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and
        said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child
        shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and
        upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that
        burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon
        thee.

013:003 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign
        which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent,
        and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.

013:004 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of
        the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel,
        that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on
        him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up,
        so that he could not pull it in again to him.

013:005 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the
        altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by
        the word of the LORD.

013:006 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat
        now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my
        hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the
        LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became
        as it was before.

013:007 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and
        refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.

013:008 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me
        half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I
        eat bread nor drink water in this place:

013:009 For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat
        no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that
        thou camest.

013:010 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he
        came to Bethel.

013:011 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came
        and told him all the works that the man of God had done that
        day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king,
        them they told also to their father.

013:012 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his
        sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from
        Judah.

013:013 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled
        him the ass: and he rode thereon,

013:014 And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an
        oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest
        from Judah? And he said, I am.

013:015 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.

013:016 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
        neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this
        place:

013:017 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat
        no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the
        way that thou camest.

013:018 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an
        angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him
        back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and
        drink water. But he lied unto him.

013:019 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and
        drank water.

013:020 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word
        of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:

013:021 And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying,
        Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the
        mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the
        LORD thy God commanded thee,

013:022 But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the
        place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread,
        and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the
        sepulchre of thy fathers.

013:023 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he
        had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the
        prophet whom he had brought back.

013:024 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:
        and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it,
        the lion also stood by the carcase.

013:025 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the
        way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and
        told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.

013:026 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
        thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient
        unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered
        him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him,
        according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.

013:027 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
        saddled him.

013:028 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass
        and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten
        the carcase, nor torn the ass.

013:029 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and
        laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet
        came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.

013:030 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned
        over him, saying, Alas, my brother!

013:031 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to
        his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the
        sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones
        beside his bones:

013:032 For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against
        the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high
        places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come
        to pass.

013:033 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but
        made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high
        places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one
        of the priests of the high places.

013:034 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to
        cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

014:001 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.

014:002 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and
        disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of
        Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the
        prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.

014:003 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
        honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of
        the child.

014:004 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and
        came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his
        eyes were set by reason of his age.

014:005 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam
        cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick:
        thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when
        she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another
        woman.

014:006 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she
        came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of
        Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am
        sent to thee with heavy tidings.

014:007 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
        Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made
        thee prince over my people Israel,

014:008 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it
        thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept
        my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do
        that only which was right in mine eyes;

014:009 But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou
        hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to
        provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:

014:010 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of
        Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth
        against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
        and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a
        man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.

014:011 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and
        him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat:
        for the LORD hath spoken it.

014:012 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when
        thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.

014:013 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only
        of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is
        found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the
        house of Jeroboam.

014:014 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who
        shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even
        now.

014:015 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
        water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land,
        which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond
        the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the
        LORD to anger.

014:016 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
        who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.

014:017 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
        and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child
        died;

014:018 And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according
        to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his
        servant Ahijah the prophet.

014:019 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how
        he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the
        chronicles of the kings of Israel.

014:020 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
        and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in
        his stead.

014:021 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was
        forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
        seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did
        choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.
        And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.

014:022 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked
        him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed,
        above all that their fathers had done.

014:023 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves,
        on every high hill, and under every green tree.

014:024 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did
        according to all the abominations of the nations which the
        LORD cast out before the children of Israel.

014:025 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that
        Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:

014:026 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and
        the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and
        he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.

014:027 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and
        committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which
        kept the door of the king's house.

014:028 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,
        that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard
        chamber.

014:029 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

014:030 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their
        days.

014:031 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah
        an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.

015:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
        reigned Abijam over Judah.

015:002 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was
        Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

015:003 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
        before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his
        God, as the heart of David his father.

015:004 Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a
        lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to
        establish Jerusalem:

015:005 Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the
        LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded
        him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah
        the Hittite.

015:006 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days
        of his life.

015:007 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

015:008 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the
        city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

015:009 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned
        Asa over Judah.

015:010 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

015:011 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as
        did David his father.

015:012 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed
        all the idols that his fathers had made.

015:013 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being
        queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa
        destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.

015:014 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart
        was perfect with the LORD all his days.

015:015 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated,
        and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of
        the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.

015:016 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
        their days.

015:017 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built
        Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to
        Asa king of Judah.

015:018 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in
        the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of
        the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his
        servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of
        Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at
        Damascus, saying,

015:019 There is a league between me and thee, and between my father
        and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of
        silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of
        Israel, that he may depart from me.

015:020 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
        the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote
        Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with
        all the land of Naphtali.

015:021 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left
        off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

015:022 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none
        was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the
        timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa
        built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

015:023 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all
        that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
        Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his
        feet.

015:024 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his
        son reigned in his stead.

015:025 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in
        the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel
        two years.

015:026 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
        way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to
        sin.

015:027 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
        conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon,
        which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel
        laid siege to Gibbethon.

015:028 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay
        him, and reigned in his stead.

015:029 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the
        house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed,
        until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the
        LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:

015:030 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he
        made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the
        LORD God of Israel to anger.

015:031 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Israel?

015:032 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
        their days.

015:033 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of
        Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four
        years.

015:034 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
        way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to
        sin.

016:001 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani
        against Baasha, saying,

016:002 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee
        prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way
        of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke
        me to anger with their sins;

016:003 Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the
        posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house
        of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

016:004 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and
        him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air
        eat.

016:005 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his
        might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
        the kings of Israel?

016:006 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah:
        and Elah his son reigned in his stead.

016:007 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani
        came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his
        house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the
        LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in
        being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.

016:008 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah
        the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.

016:009 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
        against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in
        the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.

016:010 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty
        and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his
        stead.

016:011 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
        on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left
        him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his
        kinsfolks, nor of his friends.

016:012 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to
        the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu
        the prophet.

016:013 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by
        which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in
        provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

016:014 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Israel?

016:015 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
        reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped
        against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.

016:016 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath
        conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel
        made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day
        in the camp.

016:017 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and
        they besieged Tirzah.

016:018 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
        that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt
        the king's house over him with fire, and died.

016:019 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the
        LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which
        he did, to make Israel to sin.

016:020 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he
        wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
        the kings of Israel?

016:021 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of
        the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king;
        and half followed Omri.

016:022 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people
        that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri
        reigned.

016:023 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri
        to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in
        Tirzah.

016:024 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
        silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city
        which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill,
        Samaria.

016:025 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse
        than all that were before him.

016:026 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and
        in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the
        LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

016:027 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
        that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the
        chronicles of the kings of Israel?

016:028 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and
        Ahab his son reigned in his stead.

016:029 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began
        Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of
        Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.

016:030 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD
        above all that were before him.

016:031 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him
        to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took
        to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians,
        and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.

016:032 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which
        he had built in Samaria.

016:033 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD
        God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were
        before him.

016:034 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the
        foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the
        gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word
        of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.

017:001 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
        said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom
        I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but
        according to my word.

017:002 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

017:003 Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by
        the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

017:004 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I
        have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

017:005 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he
        went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

017:006 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and
        bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.

017:007 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,
        because there had been no rain in the land.

017:008 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

017:009 Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and
        dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to
        sustain thee.

017:010 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the
        gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering
        of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray
        thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.

017:011 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,
        Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.

017:012 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake,
        but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a
        cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go
        in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and
        die.

017:013 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast
        said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it
        unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.

017:014 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal
        shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until
        the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.

017:015 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and
        she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.

017:016 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of
        oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by
        Elijah.

017:017 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the
        woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness
        was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.

017:018 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou
        man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to
        remembrance, and to slay my son?

017:019 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of
        her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and
        laid him upon his own bed.

017:020 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou
        also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by
        slaying her son?

017:021 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried
        unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this
        child's soul come into him again.

017:022 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the
        child came into him again, and he revived.

017:023 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
        chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and
        Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.

017:024 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art
        a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is
        truth.

018:001 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD
        came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself
        unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.

018:002 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a
        sore famine in Samaria.

018:003 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.
        (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:

018:004 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD,
        that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty
        in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)

018:005 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all
        fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may
        find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose
        not all the beasts.

018:006 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:
        Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by
        himself.

018:007 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he
        knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my
        lord Elijah?

018:008 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah
        is here.

018:009 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver
        thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?

018:010 As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom,
        whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they
        said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and
        nation, that they found thee not.

018:011 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
        here.

018:012 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee,
        that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know
        not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find
        thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from
        my youth.

018:013 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
        prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's
        prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and
        water?

018:014 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
        here: and he shall slay me.

018:015 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
        stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.

018:016 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to
        meet Elijah.

018:017 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto
        him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?

018:018 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy
        father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of
        the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.

018:019 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount
        Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and
        the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at
        Jezebel's table.

018:020 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
        prophets together unto mount Carmel.

018:021 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt
        ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but
        if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a
        word.

018:022 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a
        prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and
        fifty men.

018:023 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose
        one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it
        on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other
        bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:

018:024 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the
        name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him
        be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well
        spoken.

018:025 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one
        bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many;
        and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.

018:026 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they
        dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even
        until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice,
        nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which
        was made.

018:027 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and
        said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he
        is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he
        sleepeth, and must be awaked.

018:028 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner
        with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.

018:029 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied
        until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that
        there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that
        regarded.

018:030 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And
        all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar
        of the LORD that was broken down.

018:031 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the
        tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD
        came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:

018:032 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD:
        and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would
        contain two measures of seed.

018:033 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces,
        and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with
        water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.

018:034 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second
        time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the
        third time.

018:035 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the
        trench also with water.

018:036 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
        sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD
        God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day
        that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and
        that I have done all these things at thy word.

018:037 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou
        art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back
        again.

018:038 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt
        sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and
        licked up the water that was in the trench.

018:039 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and
        they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.

018:040 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not
        one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought
        them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.

018:041 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for
        there is a sound of abundance of rain.

018:042 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the
        top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and
        put his face between his knees,

018:043 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And
        he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he
        said, Go again seven times.

018:044 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,
        there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's
        hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot,
        and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.

018:045 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was
        black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And
        Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.

018:046 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his
        loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

019:001 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how
        he had slain all the prophets with the sword.

019:002 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the
        gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the
        life of one of them by to morrow about this time.

019:003 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and
        came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his
        servant there.

019:004 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and
        came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for
        himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O
        LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.

019:005 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an
        angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.

019:006 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the
        coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and
        drink, and laid him down again.

019:007 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and
        touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is
        too great for thee.

019:008 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength
        of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount
        of God.

019:009 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and,
        behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto
        him, What doest thou here, Elijah?

019:010 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
        hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
        thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the
        sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to
        take it away.

019:011 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the
        LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong
        wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before
        the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind
        an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:

019:012 And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the
        fire: and after the fire a still small voice.

019:013 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face
        in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of
        the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said,
        What doest thou here, Elijah?

019:014 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
        hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy
        covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets
        with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my
        life, to take it away.

019:015 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the
        wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to
        be king over Syria:

019:016 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over
        Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt
        thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.

019:017 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of
        Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword
        of Jehu shall Elisha slay.

019:018 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees
        which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not
        kissed him.

019:019 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,
        who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he
        with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his
        mantle upon him.

019:020 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me,
        I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will
        follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what
        have I done to thee?

019:021 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and
        slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the
        oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he
        arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

020:001 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:
        and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and
        chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred
        against it.

020:002 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city,
        and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,

020:003 Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy
        children, even the goodliest, are mine.

020:004 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,
        according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.

020:005 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh
        Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou
        shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and
        thy children;

020:006 Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this
        time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy
        servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in
        thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.

020:007 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and
        said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief:
        for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for
        my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.

020:008 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken
        not unto him, nor consent.

020:009 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my
        lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at
        the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the
        messengers departed, and brought him word again.

020:010 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,
        and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for
        handfuls for all the people that follow me.

020:011 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not
        him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that
        putteth it off.

020:012 And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he
        was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said
        unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set
        themselves in array against the city.

020:013 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,
        saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great
        multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day;
        and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

020:014 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even
        by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he
        said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.

020:015 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the
        provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after
        them he numbered all the people, even all the children of
        Israel, being seven thousand.

020:016 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself
        drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two
        kings that helped him.

020:017 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
        first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There
        are men come out of Samaria.

020:018 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them
        alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.

020:019 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of
        the city, and the army which followed them.

020:020 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and
        Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on
        an horse with the horsemen.

020:021 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and
        chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.

020:022 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,
        Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for
        at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up
        against thee.

020:023 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their
        gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than
        we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we
        shall be stronger than they.

020:024 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his
        place, and put captains in their rooms:

020:025 And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost,
        horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight
        against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger
        than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.

020:026 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad
        numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against
        Israel.

020:027 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all
        present, and went against them: and the children of Israel
        pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the
        Syrians filled the country.

020:028 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of
        Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians
        have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of
        the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude
        into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

020:029 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so
        it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the
        children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand
        footmen in one day.

020:030 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall
        fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left.
        And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner
        chamber.

020:031 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that
        the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I
        pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our
        heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will
        save thy life.

020:032 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on
        their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy
        servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said,
        Is he yet alive? he is my brother.

020:033 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would
        come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy
        brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then
        Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into
        the chariot.

020:034 And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took
        from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets
        for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said
        Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a
        covenant with him, and sent him away.

020:035 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
        neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And
        the man refused to smite him.

020:036 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice
        of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a
        lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him,
        a lion found him, and slew him.

020:037 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee.
        And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.

020:038 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way,
        and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.

020:039 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he
        said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and,
        behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and
        said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall
        thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of
        silver.

020:040 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And
        the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be;
        thyself hast decided it.

020:041 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the
        king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.

020:042 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast
        let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter
        destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy
        people for his people.

020:043 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,
        and came to Samaria.

021:001 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the
        Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the
        palace of Ahab king of Samaria.

021:002 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that
        I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto
        my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than
        it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of
        it in money.

021:003 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should
        give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.

021:004 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of
        the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he
        had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.
        And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face,
        and would eat no bread.

021:005 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is
        thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?

021:006 And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the
        Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money;
        or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard
        for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.

021:007 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the
        kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart
        be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the
        Jezreelite.

021:008 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his
        seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles
        that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.

021:009 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set
        Naboth on high among the people:

021:010 And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness
        against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king.
        And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.

021:011 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who
        were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto
        them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent
        unto them.

021:012 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the
        people.

021:013 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before
        him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against
        Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did
        blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of
        the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.

021:014 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is
        dead.

021:015 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was
        stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take
        possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he
        refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but
        dead.

021:016 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,
        that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the
        Jezreelite, to take possession of it.

021:017 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

021:018 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in
        Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he
        is gone down to possess it.

021:019 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD,
        Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt
        speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place
        where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy
        blood, even thine.

021:020 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And
        he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself
        to work evil in the sight of the LORD.

021:021 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
        posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against
        the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,

021:022 And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son
        of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for
        the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and
        made Israel to sin.

021:023 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat
        Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.

021:024 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him
        that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.

021:025 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to
        work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his
        wife stirred up.

021:026 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to
        all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before
        the children of Israel.

021:027 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent
        his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and
        lay in sackcloth, and went softly.

021:028 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

021:029 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he
        humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his
        days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his
        house.

022:001 And they continued three years without war between Syria and
        Israel.

022:002 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the
        king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.

022:003 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that
        Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out
        of the hand of the king of Syria?

022:004 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle
        to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I
        am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy
        horses.

022:005 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
        thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

022:006 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about
        four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against
        Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go
        up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.

022:007 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
        besides, that we might enquire of him?

022:008 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
        man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the
        LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning
        me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

022:009 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten
        hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.

022:010 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
        each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place
        in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets
        prophesied before them.

022:011 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and
        he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the
        Syrians, until thou have consumed them.

022:012 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
        Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into
        the king's hand.

022:013 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto
        him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare
        good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee,
        be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.

022:014 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto
        me, that will I speak.

022:015 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,
        shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we
        forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD
        shall deliver it into the hand of the king.

022:016 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee
        that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name
        of the LORD?

022:017 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as
        sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have
        no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.

022:018 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
        thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?

022:019 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw
        the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven
        standing by him on his right hand and on his left.

022:020 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up
        and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and
        another said on that manner.

022:021 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
        said, I will persuade him.

022:022 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
        forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
        prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail
        also: go forth, and do so.

022:023 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
        mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil
        concerning thee.

022:024 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah
        on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD
        from me to speak unto thee?

022:025 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when
        thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

022:026 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
        unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
        son;

022:027 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
        and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
        affliction, until I come in peace.

022:028 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD
        hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every
        one of you.

022:029 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
        up to Ramothgilead.

022:030 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
        myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.
        And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the
        battle.

022:031 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains
        that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with
        small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.

022:032 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
        Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel.
        And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat
        cried out.

022:033 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots
        perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned
        back from pursuing him.

022:034 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
        of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said
        unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me
        out of the host; for I am wounded.

022:035 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up
        in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the
        blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.

022:036 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the
        going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and
        every man to his own country.

022:037 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
        the king in Samaria.

022:038 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the
        dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour;
        according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.

022:039 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the
        ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built,
        are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel?

022:040 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in
        his stead.

022:041 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in
        the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.

022:042 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to
        reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And
        his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

022:043 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not
        aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the
        LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for
        the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.

022:044 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.

022:045 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
        shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of
        the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

022:046 And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days
        of his father Asa, he took out of the land.

022:047 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.

022:048 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold:
        but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.

022:049 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my
        servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat
        would not.

022:050 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
        his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his
        son reigned in his stead.

022:051 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
        the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned
        two years over Israel.

022:052 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
        way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the
        way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:

022:053 For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger
        the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had
        done.

Book 12	2 Kings

001:001 Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.

001:002 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber
        that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and
        said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron
        whether I shall recover of this disease.

001:003 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise,
        go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say
        unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel,
        that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?

001:004 Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down
        from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
        And Elijah departed.

001:005 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto
        them, Why are ye now turned back?

001:006 And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and
        said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and
        say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is
        not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub
        the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that
        bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

001:007 And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up
        to meet you, and told you these words?

001:008 And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a
        girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah
        the Tishbite.

001:009 Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty.
        And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an
        hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath
        said, Come down.

001:010 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be
        a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume
        thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and
        consumed him and his fifty.

001:011 Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his
        fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus
        hath the king said, Come down quickly.

001:012 And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God,
        let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy
        fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed
        him and his fifty.

001:013 And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
        And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on
        his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him,
        O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these
        fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.

001:014 Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two
        captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore
        let my life now be precious in thy sight.

001:015 And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him:
        be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him
        unto the king.

001:016 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou
        hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron,
        is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his
        word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which
        thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

001:017 So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had
        spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of
        Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had
        no son.

001:018 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

002:001 And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into
        heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from
        Gilgal.

002:002 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the
        LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the
        LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So
        they went down to Bethel.

002:003 And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to
        Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will
        take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I
        know it; hold ye your peace.

002:004 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for
        the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD
        liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they
        came to Jericho.

002:005 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to
        Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will
        take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered,
        Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.

002:006 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the
        LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth,
        and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two
        went on.

002:007 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to
        view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.

002:008 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote
        the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that
        they two went over on dry ground.

002:009 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah
        said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be
        taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a
        double portion of thy spirit be upon me.

002:010 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if
        thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto
        thee; but if not, it shall not be so.

002:011 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
        behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire,
        and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a
        whirlwind into heaven.

002:012 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the
        chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no
        more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in
        two pieces.

002:013 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and
        went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;

002:014 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote
        the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and
        when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and
        thither: and Elisha went over.

002:015 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at
        Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on
        Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the
        ground before him.

002:016 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants
        fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy
        master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken
        him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.
        And he said, Ye shall not send.

002:017 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send.
        They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but
        found him not.

002:018 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,)
        he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?

002:019 And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee,
        the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but
        the water is naught, and the ground barren.

002:020 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And
        they brought it to him.

002:021 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the
        salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed
        these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or
        barren land.

002:022 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the
        saying of Elisha which he spake.

002:023 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up
        by the way, there came forth little children out of the city,
        and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go
        up, thou bald head.

002:024 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the
        name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of
        the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.

002:025 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he
        returned to Samaria.

003:001 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in
        Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and
        reigned twelve years.

003:002 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his
        father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal
        that his father had made.

003:003 Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of
        Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

003:004 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto
        the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred
        thousand rams, with the wool.

003:005 But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
        rebelled against the king of Israel.

003:006 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and
        numbered all Israel.

003:007 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying,
        The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with
        me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as
        thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy
        horses.

003:008 And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The
        way through the wilderness of Edom.

003:009 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the
        king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days'
        journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the
        cattle that followed them.

003:010 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called
        these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of
        Moab!

003:011 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD,
        that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of
        Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of
        Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.

003:012 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the
        king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down
        to him.

003:013 And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do
        with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the
        prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him,
        Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to
        deliver them into the hand of Moab.

003:014 And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
        stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of
        Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee,
        nor see thee.

003:015 But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the
        minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.

003:016 And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of
        ditches.

003:017 For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall
        ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that
        ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.

003:018 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he
        will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.

003:019 And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city,
        and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water,
        and mar every good piece of land with stones.

003:020 And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was
        offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom,
        and the country was filled with water.

003:021 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to
        fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on
        armour, and upward, and stood in the border.

003:022 And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon
        the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as
        red as blood:

003:023 And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and
        they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the
        spoil.

003:024 And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose
        up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but
        they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.

003:025 And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land
        cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all
        the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in
        Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers
        went about it, and smote it.

003:026 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for
        him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to
        break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.

003:027 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his
        stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And
        there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed
        from him, and returned to their own land.

004:001 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of
        the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is
        dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and
        the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be
        bondmen.

004:002 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me,
        what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath
        not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.

004:003 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
        neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.

004:004 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee
        and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels,
        and thou shalt set aside that which is full.

004:005 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her
        sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.

004:006 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said
        unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her,
        There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.

004:007 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell
        the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of
        the rest.

004:008 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was
        a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it
        was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat
        bread.

004:009 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that
        this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.

004:010 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and
        let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and
        a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he
        shall turn in thither.

004:011 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into
        the chamber, and lay there.

004:012 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And
        when he had called her, she stood before him.

004:013 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been
        careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for
        thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the
        captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own
        people.

004:014 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi
        answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.

004:015 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood
        in the door.

004:016 And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,
        thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man
        of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.

004:017 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that
        Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.

004:018 And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went
        out to his father to the reapers.

004:019 And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to
        a lad, Carry him to his mother.

004:020 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he
        sat on her knees till noon, and then died.

004:021 And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God,
        and shut the door upon him, and went out.

004:022 And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray
        thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may
        run to the man of God, and come again.

004:023 And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is
        neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.

004:024 Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and
        go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.

004:025 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And
        it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he
        said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:

004:026 Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it
        well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with
        the child? And she answered, It is well:

004:027 And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught
        him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And
        the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed
        within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not
        told me.

004:028 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say,
        Do not deceive me?

004:029 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff
        in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute
        him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay
        my staff upon the face of the child.

004:030 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as
        thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and
        followed her.

004:031 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the
        face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing.
        Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The
        child is not awaked.

004:032 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was
        dead, and laid upon his bed.

004:033 He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
        prayed unto the LORD.

004:034 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon
        his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his
        hands: and stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of
        the child waxed warm.

004:035 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went
        up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed
        seven times, and the child opened his eyes.

004:036 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
        called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take
        up thy son.

004:037 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to
        the ground, and took up her son, and went out.

004:038 And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the
        land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him:
        and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe
        pottage for the sons of the prophets.

004:039 And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a
        wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and
        came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew
        them not.

004:040 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as
        they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and
        said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they
        could not eat thereof.

004:041 But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and
        he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there
        was no harm in the pot.

004:042 And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of
        God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and
        full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto
        the people, that they may eat.

004:043 And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an
        hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may
        eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave
        thereof.

004:044 So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,
        according to the word of the LORD.

005:001 Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a
        great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the
        LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty
        man in valour, but he was a leper.

005:002 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought
        away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she
        waited on Naaman's wife.

005:003 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with
        the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of
        his leprosy.

005:004 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said
        the maid that is of the land of Israel.

005:005 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a
        letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with
        him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold,
        and ten changes of raiment.

005:006 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now
        when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith
        sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him
        of his leprosy.

005:007 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the
        letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill
        and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover
        a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see
        how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

005:008 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the
        king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king,
        saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now
        to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

005:009 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood
        at the door of the house of Elisha.

005:010 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in
        Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee,
        and thou shalt be clean.

005:011 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I
        thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on
        the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the
        place, and recover the leper.

005:012 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all
        the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So
        he turned and went away in a rage.

005:013 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My
        father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing,
        wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he
        saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?

005:014 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
        according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came
        again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.

005:015 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and
        came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know
        that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now
        therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.

005:016 But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will
        receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.

005:017 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given
        to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant
        will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice
        unto other gods, but unto the LORD.

005:018 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master
        goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he
        leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon:
        when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon
        thy servant in this thing.

005:019 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a
        little way.

005:020 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said,
        Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not
        receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD
        liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.

005:021 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him
        running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet
        him, and said, Is all well?

005:022 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying,
        Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two
        young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee,
        a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.

005:023 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged
        him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two
        changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants;
        and they bare them before him.

005:024 And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand,
        and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and
        they departed.

005:025 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said
        unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant
        went no whither.

005:026 And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the
        man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time
        to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and
        vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
        maidservants?

005:027 The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and
        unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a
        leper as white as snow.

006:001 And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the
        place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.

006:002 Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every
        man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may
        dwell. And he answered, Go ye.

006:003 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy
        servants. And he answered, I will go.

006:004 So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut
        down wood.

006:005 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the
        water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was
        borrowed.

006:006 And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the
        place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and
        the iron did swim.

006:007 Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his
        hand, and took it.

006:008 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel
        with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be
        my camp.

006:009 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying,
        Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the
        Syrians are come down.

006:010 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God
        told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once
        nor twice.

006:011 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for
        this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them,
        Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?

006:012 And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but
        Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of
        Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.

006:013 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch
        him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.

006:014 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great
        host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.

006:015 And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and
        gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with
        horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my
        master! how shall we do?

006:016 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more
        than they that be with them.

006:017 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,
        that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young
        man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses
        and chariots of fire round about Elisha.

006:018 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD,
        and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And
        he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.

006:019 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is
        this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom
        ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.

006:020 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that
        Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may
        see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and,
        behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.

006:021 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My
        father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?

006:022 And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou
        smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and
        with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may
        eat and drink, and go to their master.

006:023 And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had
        eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their
        master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of
        Israel.

006:024 And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria
        gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.

006:025 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they
        besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces
        of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for
        five pieces of silver.

006:026 And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there
        cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.

006:027 And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help
        thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?

006:028 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she
        answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may
        eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.

006:029 So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on
        the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath
        hid her son.

006:030 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the
        woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the
        wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth
        within upon his flesh.

006:031 Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of
        Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.

006:032 But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and
        the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger
        came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a
        murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the
        messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the
        door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?

006:033 And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came
        down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD;
        what should I wait for the LORD any longer?

007:001 Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the
        LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour
        be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel,
        in the gate of Samaria.

007:002 Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of
        God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in
        heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt
        see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.

007:003 And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the
        gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we
        die?

007:004 If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in
        the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we
        die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of
        the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they
        kill us, we shall but die.

007:005 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the
        Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the
        camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.

007:006 For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise
        of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great
        host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel
        hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings
        of the Egyptians, to come upon us.

007:007 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their
        tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it
        was, and fled for their life.

007:008 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp,
        they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried
        thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and
        came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence
        also, and went and hid it.

007:009 Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a
        day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till
        the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now
        therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.

007:010 So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they
        told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and,
        behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but
        horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.

007:011 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's
        house within.

007:012 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I
        will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know
        that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to
        hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of
        the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.

007:013 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I
        pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in
        the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel
        that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the
        multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us
        send and see.

007:014 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent
        after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.

007:015 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was
        full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away
        in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the
        king.

007:016 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians.
        So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two
        measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the
        LORD.

007:017 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to
        have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in
        the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake
        when the king came down to him.

007:018 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,
        saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of
        fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in
        the gate of Samaria:

007:019 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold,
        if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing
        be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes,
        but shalt not eat thereof.

007:020 And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in
        the gate, and he died.

008:001 Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to
        life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and
        sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath
        called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land
        seven years.

008:002 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of
        God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the
        land of the Philistines seven years.

008:003 And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman
        returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went
        forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.

008:004 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
        saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha
        hath done.

008:005 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had
        restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose
        son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house
        and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is
        the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.

008:006 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
        appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that
        was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that
        she left the land, even until now.

008:007 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria
        was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come
        hither.

008:008 And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand,
        and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him,
        saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

008:009 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even
        of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and
        came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of
        Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this
        disease?

008:010 And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest
        certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he
        shall surely die.

008:011 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was
        ashamed: and the man of God wept.

008:012 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because
        I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel:
        their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men
        wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children,
        and rip up their women with child.

008:013 And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he
        should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath
        shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.

008:014 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said
        to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me
        that thou shouldest surely recover.

008:015 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,
        and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he
        died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.

008:016 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
        Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je
        hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.

008:017 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he
        reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

008:018 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the
        house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he
        did evil in the sight of the LORD.

008:019 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's
        sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his
        children.

008:020 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and
        made a king over themselves.

008:021 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and
        he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him
        about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled
        into their tents.

008:022 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
        Then Libnah revolted at the same time.

008:023 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

008:024 And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in
        his stead.

008:025 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel
        did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.

008:026 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign;
        and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
        was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.

008:027 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in
        the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was
        the son in law of the house of Ahab.

008:028 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against
        Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded
        Joram.

008:029 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
        which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought
        against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram
        king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in
        Jezreel, because he was sick.

009:001 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the
        prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this
        box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:

009:002 And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of
        Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise
        up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;

009:003 Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say,
        Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
        Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.

009:004 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
        Ramothgilead.

009:005 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were
        sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And
        Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O
        captain.

009:006 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil
        on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
        Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD,
        even over Israel.

009:007 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may
        avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of
        all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.

009:008 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off
        from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is
        shut up and left in Israel:

009:009 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam
        the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of
        Ahijah:

009:010 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and
        there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and
        fled.

009:011 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said
        unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?
        And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.

009:012 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and
        thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have
        anointed thee king over Israel.

009:013 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it
        under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets,
        saying, Jehu is king.

009:014 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
        against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all
        Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.

009:015 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the
        wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with
        Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds,
        then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to
        tell it in Jezreel.

009:016 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay
        there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.

009:017 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he
        spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a
        company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet
        them, and let him say, Is it peace?

009:018 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus
        saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to
        do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told,
        saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.

009:019 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them,
        and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered,
        What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.

009:020 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and
        cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu
        the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.

009:021 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready.
        And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out,
        each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met
        him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.

009:022 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it
        peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the
        whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so
        many?

009:023 And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah,
        There is treachery, O Ahaziah.

009:024 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
        between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he
        sunk down in his chariot.

009:025 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in
        the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for
        remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab
        his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;

009:026 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the
        blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in
        this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him
        into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.

009:027 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the
        way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and
        said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the
        going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo,
        and died there.

009:028 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
        buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of
        David.

009:029 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began
        Ahaziah to reign over Judah.

009:030 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and
        she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a
        window.

009:031 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,
        who slew his master?

009:032 And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on
        my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three
        eunuchs.

009:033 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some
        of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and
        he trode her under foot.

009:034 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go,
        see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's
        daughter.

009:035 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than
        the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

009:036 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is
        the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the
        Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the
        flesh of Jezebel:

009:037 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of
        the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not
        say, This is Jezebel.

010:001 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters,
        and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the
        elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,

010:002 Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's
        sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses,
        a fenced city also, and armour;

010:003 Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and
        set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's
        house.

010:004 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings
        stood not before him: how then shall we stand?

010:005 And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city,
        the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to
        Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou
        shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is
        good in thine eyes.

010:006 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye
        be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the
        heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel
        by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy
        persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought
        them up.

010:007 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they
        took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their
        heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.

010:008 And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have
        brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them
        in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.

010:009 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and
        stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I
        conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all
        these?

010:010 Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the
        word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of
        Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his
        servant Elijah.

010:011 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in
        Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his
        priests, until he left him none remaining.

010:012 And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was
        at the shearing house in the way,

010:013 Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said,
        Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah;
        and we go down to salute the children of the king and the
        children of the queen.

010:014 And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and
        slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty
        men; neither left he any of them.

010:015 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the
        son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said
        to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?
        And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand.
        And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the
        chariot.

010:016 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So
        they made him ride in his chariot.

010:017 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto
        Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the
        saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.

010:018 And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them,
        Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.

010:019 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
        servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have
        a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting,
        he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent
        that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.

010:020 And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
        proclaimed it.

010:021 And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of
        Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And
        they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was
        full from one end to another.

010:022 And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth
        vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them
        forth vestments.

010:023 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house
        of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and
        look that there be here with you none of the servants of the
        LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.

010:024 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,
        Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the
        men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that
        letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.

010:025 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering
        the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the
        captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they
        smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the
        captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of
        Baal.

010:026 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal,
        and burned them.

010:027 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the
        house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.

010:028 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

010:029 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
        Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the
        golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.

010:030 And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in
        executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto
        the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy
        children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of
        Israel.

010:031 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of
        Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins
        of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.

010:032 In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael
        smote them in all the coasts of Israel;

010:033 From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and
        the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by
        the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.

010:034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all
        his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?

010:035 And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in
        Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

010:036 And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was
        twenty and eight years.

011:001 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
        dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.

011:002 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
        took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the
        king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and
        his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not
        slain.

011:003 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years.
        And Athaliah did reign over the land.

011:004 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
        hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to
        him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them,
        and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed
        them the king's son.

011:005 And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall
        do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall
        even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;

011:006 And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part
        at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of
        the house, that it be not broken down.

011:007 And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even
        they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the
        king.

011:008 And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his
        weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let
        him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as
        he cometh in.

011:009 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things
        that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man
        his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that
        should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.

011:010 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
        David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the
        LORD.

011:011 And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,
        round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to
        the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the
        temple.

011:012 And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon
        him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and
        anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save
        the king.

011:013 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the
        people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.

011:014 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as
        the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the
        king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with
        trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason,
        Treason.

011:015 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the
        hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have
        her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill
        with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain
        in the house of the LORD.

011:016 And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the
        which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she
        slain.

011:017 And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and
        the people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the
        king also and the people.

011:018 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal,
        and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in
        pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before
        the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house
        of the LORD.

011:019 And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and
        the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought
        down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way
        of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on
        the throne of the kings.

011:020 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in
        quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's
        house.

011:021 Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.

012:001 In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty
        years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
        Zibiah of Beersheba.

012:002 And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD
        all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

012:003 But the high places were not taken away: the people still
        sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

012:004 And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the
        dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD,
        even the money of every one that passeth the account, the
        money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh
        into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,

012:005 Let the priests take it to them, every man of his
        acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house,
        wheresoever any breach shall be found.

012:006 But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king
        Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the
        house.

012:007 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the
        other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the
        breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of
        your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the
        house.

012:008 And the priests consented to receive no more money of the
        people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.

012:009 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the
        lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as
        one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that
        kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into
        the house of the LORD.

012:010 And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the
        chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and
        they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the
        house of the LORD.

012:011 And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them
        that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the
        LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders,
        that wrought upon the house of the LORD,

012:012 And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and
        hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD,
        and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.

012:013 Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of
        silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or
        vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the
        house of the LORD:

012:014 But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the
        house of the LORD.

012:015 Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they
        delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt
        faithfully.

012:016 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the
        house of the LORD: it was the priests'.

012:017 Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath,
        and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.

012:018 And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that
        Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of
        Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the
        gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD,
        and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria:
        and he went away from Jerusalem.

012:019 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

012:020 And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash
        in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.

012:021 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of
        Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried
        him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son
        reigned in his stead.

013:001 In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah
        king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over
        Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.

013:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and
        followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made
        Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

013:003 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
        delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into
        the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.

013:004 And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto
        him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of
        Syria oppressed them.

013:005 (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out
        from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel
        dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.

013:006 Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
        Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there
        remained the grove also in Samaria.)

013:007 Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty
        horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the
        king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the
        dust by threshing.

013:008 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and
        his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
        of the kings of Israel?

013:009 And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in
        Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.

013:010 In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began
        Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria,
        and reigned sixteen years.

013:011 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he
        departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
        who made Israel sin: but he walked therein.

013:012 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and
        his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah,
        are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel?

013:013 And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his
        throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of
        Israel.

013:014 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.
        And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over
        his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of
        Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

013:015 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took
        unto him bow and arrows.

013:016 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the
        bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands
        upon the king's hands.

013:017 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then
        Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the
        LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria:
        for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have
        consumed them.

013:018 And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said
        unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote
        thrice, and stayed.

013:019 And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou
        shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou
        smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou
        shalt smite Syria but thrice.

013:020 And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the
        Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.

013:021 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold,
        they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the
        sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and
        touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his
        feet.

013:022 But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of
        Jehoahaz.

013:023 And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on
        them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with
        Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither
        cast he them from his presence as yet.

013:024 So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in
        his stead.

013:025 And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of
        Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out
        of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did
        Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

014:001 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
        reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.

014:002 He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
        reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

014:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet
        not like David his father: he did according to all things as
        Joash his father did.

014:004 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people
        did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.

014:005 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in
        his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king
        his father.

014:006 But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto
        that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein
        the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to
        death for the children, nor the children be put to death for
        the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own
        sin.

014:007 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took
        Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this
        day.

014:008 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz
        son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one
        another in the face.

014:009 And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
        saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
        was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
        and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and
        trode down the thistle.

014:010 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted
        thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest
        thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou,
        and Judah with thee?

014:011 But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel
        went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another
        in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

014:012 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled
        every man to their tents.

014:013 And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
        of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to
        Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate
        of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

014:014 And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that
        were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of
        the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.

014:015 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his
        might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they
        not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Israel?

014:016 And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria
        with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his
        stead.

014:017 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
        death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

014:018 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in
        the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

014:019 Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he
        fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew
        him there.

014:020 And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem
        with his fathers in the city of David.

014:021 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen
        years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.

014:022 He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
        slept with his fathers.

014:023 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of
        Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign
        in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.

014:024 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
        departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
        who made Israel to sin.

014:025 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath
        unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD
        God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant
        Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of
        Gathhepher.

014:026 For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very
        bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any
        helper for Israel.

014:027 And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of
        Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of
        Jeroboam the son of Joash.

014:028 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and
        his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and
        Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

014:029 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of
        Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.

015:001 In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel
        began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.

015:002 Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he
        reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.

015:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his father Amaziah had done;

015:004 Save that the high places were not removed: the people
        sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.

015:005 And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the
        day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the
        king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land.

015:006 And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

015:007 So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with
        his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned
        in his stead.

015:008 In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did
        Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six
        months.

015:009 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
        his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of
        Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

015:010 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote
        him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

015:011 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

015:012 This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu,
        saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the
        fourth generation. And so it came to pass.

015:013 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and
        thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full
        month in Samaria.

015:014 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
        Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and
        slew him, and reigned in his stead.

015:015 And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which
        he made, behold, they are written in the book of the
        chronicles of the kings of Israel.

015:016 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the
        coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him,
        therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were
        with child he ripped up.

015:017 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
        Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten
        years in Samaria.

015:018 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
        departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of
        Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

015:019 And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem
        gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be
        with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.

015:020 And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the
        mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to
        give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned
        back, and stayed not there in the land.

015:021 And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Israel?

015:022 And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son
        reigned in his stead.

015:023 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son
        of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned
        two years.

015:024 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
        departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
        made Israel to sin.

015:025 But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired
        against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the
        king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of
        the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.

015:026 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
        behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel.

015:027 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah
        the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and
        reigned twenty years.

015:028 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
        departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
        made Israel to sin.

015:029 In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king
        of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah,
        and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land
        of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.

015:030 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the
        son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in
        his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.

015:031 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did,
        behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Israel.

015:032 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel
        began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.

015:033 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and
        he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
        was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.

015:034 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he
        did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.

015:035 Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people
        sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He
        built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.

015:036 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

015:037 In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the
        king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.

015:038 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son
        reigned in his stead.

016:001 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the
        son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.

016:002 Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned
        sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right
        in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.

016:003 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made
        his son to pass through the fire, according to the
        abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from
        before the children of Israel.

016:004 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on
        the hills, and under every green tree.

016:005 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of
        Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz,
        but could not overcome him.

016:006 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and
        drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and
        dwelt there unto this day.

016:007 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
        saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out
        of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the
        king of Israel, which rise up against me.

016:008 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house
        of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and
        sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.

016:009 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of
        Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the
        people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.

016:010 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
        Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz
        sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the
        pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.

016:011 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that
        king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it
        against king Ahaz came from Damascus.

016:012 And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the
        altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered
        thereon.

016:013 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and
        poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his
        peace offerings, upon the altar.

016:014 And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the
        LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar
        and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the
        altar.

016:015 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the
        great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening
        meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat
        offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the
        land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and
        sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all
        the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for
        me to enquire by.

016:016 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
        commanded.

016:017 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed
        the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the
        brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon the pavement
        of stones.

016:018 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the
        house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house
        of the LORD for the king of Assyria.

016:019 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

016:020 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
        fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in
        his stead.

017:001 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son
        of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.

017:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but
        not as the kings of Israel that were before him.

017:003 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea
        became his servant, and gave him presents.

017:004 And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had
        sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to
        the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore
        the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.

017:005 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and
        went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.

017:006 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria,
        and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah
        and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the
        Medes.

017:007 For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against
        the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land
        of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
        had feared other gods,

017:008 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast
        out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of
        Israel, which they had made.

017:009 And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were
        not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high
        places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to
        the fenced city.

017:010 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and
        under every green tree:

017:011 And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did
        the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and
        wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:

017:012 For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye
        shall not do this thing.

017:013 Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by
        all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from
        your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes,
        according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and
        which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.

017:014 Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,
        like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the
        LORD their God.

017:015 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made
        with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified
        against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and
        went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning
        whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like
        them.

017:016 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and
        made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove,
        and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.

017:017 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through
        the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold
        themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him
        to anger.

017:018 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed
        them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of
        Judah only.

017:019 Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God,
        but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.

017:020 And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted
        them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he
        had cast them out of his sight.

017:021 For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made
        Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from
        following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.

017:022 For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam
        which he did; they departed not from them;

017:023 Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said
        by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away
        out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.

017:024 And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from
        Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim,
        and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the
        children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in
        the cities thereof.

017:025 And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that
        they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among
        them, which slew some of them.

017:026 Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The
        nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of
        Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore
        he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them,
        because they know not the manner of the God of the land.

017:027 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one
        of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go
        and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God
        of the land.

017:028 Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from
        Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they
        should fear the LORD.

017:029 Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in
        the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made,
        every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.

017:030 And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth
        made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,

017:031 And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites
        burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech,
        the gods of Sepharvaim.

017:032 So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the
        lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed
        for them in the houses of the high places.

017:033 They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the
        manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.

017:034 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not
        the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their
        ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD
        commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;

017:035 With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them,
        saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to
        them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:

017:036 But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with
        great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and
        him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.

017:037 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the
        commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do
        for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.

017:038 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not
        forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.

017:039 But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you
        out of the hand of all your enemies.

017:040 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former
        manner.

017:041 So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven
        images, both their children, and their children's children: as
        did their fathers, so do they unto this day.

018:001 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah
        king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah
        began to reign.

018:002 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and
        he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's
        name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.

018:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that David his father did.

018:004 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down
        the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses
        had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn
        incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.

018:005 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was
        none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were
        before him.

018:006 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,
        but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.

018:007 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he
        went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and
        served him not.

018:008 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders
        thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

018:009 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
        was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,
        that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and
        besieged it.

018:010 And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth
        year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of
        Israel, Samaria was taken.

018:011 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria,
        and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and
        in the cities of the Medes:

018:012 Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but
        transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of
        the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.

018:013 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib
        king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of
        Judah, and took them.

018:014 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to
        Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which
        thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria
        appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of
        silver and thirty talents of gold.

018:015 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the
        house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.

018:016 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of
        the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah
        king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of
        Assyria.

018:017 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh
        from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against
        Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when
        they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the
        upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.

018:018 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them
        Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and
        Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.

018:019 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
        saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is
        this wherein thou trustest?

018:020 Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and
        strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou
        rebellest against me?

018:021 Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised
        reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into
        his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all
        that trust on him.

018:022 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not
        that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath
        taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall
        worship before this altar in Jerusalem?

018:023 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king
        of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if
        thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

018:024 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
        least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for
        chariots and for horsemen?

018:025 Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to
        destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and
        destroy it.

018:026 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah,
        unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the
        Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in
        the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the
        wall.

018:027 But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy
        master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me
        to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own
        dung, and drink their own piss with you?

018:028 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
        language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king,
        the king of Assyria:

018:029 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he
        shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:

018:030 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
        LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be
        delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

018:031 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
        Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me,
        and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of
        his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his
        cistern:

018:032 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a
        land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land
        of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and
        hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The
        LORD will deliver us.

018:033 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
        out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

018:034 Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods
        of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out
        of mine hand?

018:035 Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have
        delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should
        deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?

018:036 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word:
        for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

018:037 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the
        household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph
        the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told
        him the words of Rabshakeh.

019:001 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
        his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into
        the house of the LORD.

019:002 And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna
        the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with
        sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

019:003 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day
        of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are
        come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

019:004 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of
        Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to
        reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the
        LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the
        remnant that are left.

019:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

019:006 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master,
        Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou
        hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria
        have blasphemed me.

019:007 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
        rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him
        to fall by the sword in his own land.

019:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
        against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from
        Lachish.

019:009 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he
        is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again
        unto Hezekiah, saying,

019:010 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not
        thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem
        shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

019:011 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
        all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be
        delivered?

019:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
        have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the
        children of Eden which were in Thelasar?

019:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the
        king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?

019:014 And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the
        messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house
        of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

019:015 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of
        Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the
        God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou
        hast made heaven and earth.

019:016 LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes,
        and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent
        him to reproach the living God.

019:017 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the
        nations and their lands,

019:018 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods,
        but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they
        have destroyed them.

019:019 Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us
        out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know
        that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.

019:020 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus
        saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to
        me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.

019:021 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The
        virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed
        thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head
        at thee.

019:022 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom
        hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
        even against the Holy One of Israel.

019:023 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast
        said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the
        height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut
        down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees
        thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders,
        and into the forest of his Carmel.

019:024 I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of
        my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.

019:025 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of
        ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to
        pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into
        ruinous heaps.

019:026 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
        dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field,
        and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as
        corn blasted before it be grown up.

019:027 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
        and thy rage against me.

019:028 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into
        mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my
        bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by
        which thou camest.

019:029 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year
        such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that
        which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and
        reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.

019:030 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
        yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

019:031 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
        escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall
        do this.

019:032 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,
        He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there,
        nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.

019:033 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and
        shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

019:034 For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake,
        and for my servant David's sake.

019:035 And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD
        went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred
        fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the
        morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

019:036 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and
        returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

019:037 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
        Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote
        him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia.
        And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

020:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet
        Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus
        saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die,
        and not live.

020:002 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
        saying,

020:003 I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before
        thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that
        which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

020:004 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle
        court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,

020:005 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus
        saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy
        prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on
        the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.

020:006 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver
        thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and
        I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant
        David's sake.

020:007 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid
        it on the boil, and he recovered.

020:008 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the
        LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of
        the LORD the third day?

020:009 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that
        the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the
        shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?

020:010 And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to
        go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward
        ten degrees.

020:011 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the
        shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the
        dial of Ahaz.

020:012 At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
        Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had
        heard that Hezekiah had been sick.

020:013 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the
        house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and
        the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of
        his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was
        nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah
        shewed them not.

020:014 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
        him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?
        And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from
        Babylon.

020:015 And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
        answered, All the things that are in mine house have they
        seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not
        shewed them.

020:016 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.

020:017 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and
        that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day,
        shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith
        the LORD.

020:018 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
        beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
        palace of the king of Babylon.

020:019 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
        which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace
        and truth be in my days?

020:020 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and
        how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the
        city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
        the kings of Judah?

020:021 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son
        reigned in his stead.

021:001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and
        reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Hephzibah.

021:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after
        the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before
        the children of Israel.

021:003 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his
        father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and
        made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all
        the host of heaven, and served them.

021:004 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the
        LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.

021:005 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two
        courts of the house of the LORD.

021:006 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times,
        and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and
        wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD,
        to provoke him to anger.

021:007 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the
        house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his
        son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out
        of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

021:008 Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of
        the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe
        to do according to all that I have commanded them, and
        according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.

021:009 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more
        evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the
        children of Israel.

021:010 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,

021:011 Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations,
        and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which
        were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his
        idols:

021:012 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am
        bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever
        heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.

021:013 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the
        plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a
        man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.

021:014 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and
        deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall
        become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;

021:015 Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and
        have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came
        forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.

021:016 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had
        filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin
        wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil
        in the sight of the LORD.

021:017 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and
        his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of
        the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

021:018 And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
        garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his
        son reigned in his stead.

021:019 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and
        he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
        Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

021:020 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
        his father Manasseh did.

021:021 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and
        served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:

021:022 And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in
        the way of the LORD.

021:023 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the
        king in his own house.

021:024 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
        against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his
        son king in his stead.

021:025 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not
        written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

021:026 And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and
        Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

022:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.

022:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
        walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not
        aside to the right hand or to the left.

022:003 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,
        that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of
        Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,

022:004 Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver
        which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers
        of the door have gathered of the people:

022:005 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the
        work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and
        let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the
        house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,

022:006 Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber
        and hewn stone to repair the house.

022:007 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money
        that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt
        faithfully.

022:008 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I
        have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
        Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

022:009 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
        word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money
        that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the
        hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the
        house of the LORD.

022:010 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the
        priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before
        the king.

022:011 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
        book of the law, that he rent his clothes.

022:012 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son
        of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the
        scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,

022:013 Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for
        all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found:
        for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us,
        because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this
        book, to do according unto all that which is written
        concerning us.

022:014 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan,
        and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of
        Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the
        wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and
        they communed with her.

022:015 And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
        Tell the man that sent you to me,

022:016 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
        place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of
        the book which the king of Judah hath read:

022:017 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
        other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
        works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled
        against this place, and shall not be quenched.

022:018 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the
        LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of
        Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;

022:019 Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself
        before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this
        place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should
        become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes,
        and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.

022:020 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and
        thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes
        shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.
        And they brought the king word again.

023:001 And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders
        of Judah and of Jerusalem.

023:002 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
        men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him,
        and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both
        small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of
        the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the
        LORD.

023:003 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the
        LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and
        his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all
        their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were
        written in this book. And all the people stood to the
        covenant.

023:004 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the
        priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to
        bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that
        were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of
        heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of
        Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.

023:005 And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of
        Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the
        cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them
        also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the
        moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.

023:006 And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD,
        without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the
        brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the
        powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.

023:007 And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by
        the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the
        grove.

023:008 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and
        defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense,
        from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the
        gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the
        governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the
        gate of the city.

023:009 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the
        altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the
        unleavened bread among their brethren.

023:010 And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children
        of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to
        pass through the fire to Molech.

023:011 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given
        to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by
        the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the
        suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.

023:012 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of
        Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which
        Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD,
        did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and
        cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.

023:013 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on
        the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the
        king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of
        the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the
        Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of
        Ammon, did the king defile.

023:014 And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves,
        and filled their places with the bones of men.

023:015 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place
        which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had
        made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and
        burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and
        burned the grove.

023:016 And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that
        were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of
        the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted
        it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God
        proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.

023:017 Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of
        the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God,
        which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou
        hast done against the altar of Bethel.

023:018 And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they
        let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came
        out of Samaria.

023:019 And all the houses also of the high places that were in the
        cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to
        provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them
        according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.

023:020 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there
        upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and
        returned to Jerusalem.

023:021 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the
        passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book
        of this covenant.

023:022 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of
        the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the
        kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;

023:023 But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this
        passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.

023:024 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards,
        and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that
        were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah
        put away, that he might perform the words of the law which
        were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the
        house of the LORD.

023:025 And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to
        the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with
        all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither
        after him arose there any like him.

023:026 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his
        great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah,
        because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him
        withal.

023:027 And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight,
        as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city
        Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said,
        My name shall be there.

023:028 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

023:029 In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the
        king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went
        against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.

023:030 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo,
        and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own
        sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of
        Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's
        stead.

023:031 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to
        reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

023:032 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his fathers had done.

023:033 And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of
        Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land
        to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of
        gold.

023:034 And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the
        room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim,
        and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.

023:035 And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he
        taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment
        of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people
        of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give
        it unto Pharaohnechoh.

023:036 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to
        reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

023:037 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his fathers had done.

024:001 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and
        Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and
        rebelled against him.

024:002 And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands
        of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the
        children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it,
        according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his
        servants the prophets.

024:003 Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to
        remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh,
        according to all that he did;

024:004 And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled
        Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not
        pardon.

024:005 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did,
        are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Judah?

024:006 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son
        reigned in his stead.

024:007 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:
        for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto
        the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.

024:008 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and
        he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name
        was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.

024:009 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his father had done.

024:010 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
        came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.

024:011 And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and
        his servants did besiege it.

024:012 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of
        Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his
        princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in
        the eighth year of his reign.

024:013 And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of
        the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in
        pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel
        had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.

024:014 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and
        all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and
        all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest
        sort of the people of the land.

024:015 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's
        mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty
        of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to
        Babylon.

024:016 And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen
        and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war,
        even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.

024:017 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother
        king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.

024:018 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

024:019 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

024:020 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
        and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that
        Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

025:001 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the
        tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host,
        against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built
        forts against it round about.

025:002 And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
        Zedekiah.

025:003 And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed
        in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the
        land.

025:004 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by
        night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by
        the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city
        round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.

025:005 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and
        overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were
        scattered from him.

025:006 So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of
        Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.

025:007 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put
        out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass,
        and carried him to Babylon.

025:008 And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which
        is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
        came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king
        of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:

025:009 And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and
        all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt
        he with fire.

025:010 And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain
        of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.

025:011 Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the
        fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the
        remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the
        guard carry away.

025:012 But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of
        the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.

025:013 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD,
        and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the
        LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass
        of them to Babylon.

025:014 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the
        spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they
        ministered, took they away.

025:015 And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of
        gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the
        guard took away.

025:016 The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made
        for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was
        without weight.

025:017 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the
        chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter
        three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the
        chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had
        the second pillar with wreathen work.

025:018 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
        and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the
        door:

025:019 And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the
        men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's
        presence, which were found in the city, and the principal
        scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and
        threescore men of the people of the land that were found in
        the city:

025:020 And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought
        them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:

025:021 And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in
        the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their
        land.

025:022 And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he
        made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.

025:023 And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men,
        heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor,
        there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
        Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son
        of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a
        Maachathite, they and their men.

025:024 And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto
        them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in
        the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well
        with you.

025:025 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
        of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came,
        and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and
        the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.

025:026 And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of
        the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of
        the Chaldees.

025:027 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
        captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,
        on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach
        king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up
        the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;

025:028 And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the
        throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;

025:029 And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread
        continually before him all the days of his life.

025:030 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the
        king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

004:002 And Reaiah the son of Shobal begat Jahath; and Jahath begat

004:003 And these were of the father of Etam; Jezreel, and Ishma, and

004:004 And Penuel the father of Gedor, and Ezer the father of Hushah.
        These are the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah, the

        sorrow.

004:010 And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou
        wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine
        hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from
        evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that
        which he requested.

        Ashbea,

004:022 And Jokim, and the men of Chozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, who
        had the dominion in Moab, and Jashubilehem. And these are
        ancient things.

004:023 These were the potters, and those that dwelt among plants and
        hedges: there they dwelt with the king for his work.

004:024 The sons of Simeon were, Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and

004:026 And the sons of Mishma; Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son,
        Shimei his son.

004:027 And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters: but his
        brethren had not many children, neither did all their family
        multiply, like to the children of Judah.

004:028 And they dwelt at Beersheba, and Moladah, and Hazarshual,

004:029 And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad,

004:030 And at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag,

004:031 And at Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusim, and at Bethbirei, and at
        Shaaraim. These were their cities unto the reign of David.

004:032 And their villages were, Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen,
        and Ashan, five cities:

004:033 And all their villages that were round about the same cities,
        unto Baal. These were their habitations, and their genealogy.

004:034 And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah, the son of Amaziah,

004:035 And Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah, the son of Seraiah,
        the son of Asiel,

004:036 And Elioenai, and Jaakobah, and Jeshohaiah, and Asaiah, and
        Adiel, and Jesimiel, and Benaiah,

004:037 And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of
        Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;

004:038 These mentioned by their names were princes in their families:
        and the house of their fathers increased greatly.

004:039 And they went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the east
        side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.

004:040 And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide,
        and quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt there of
        old.

004:041 And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of
        Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were
        found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and
        dwelt in their rooms: because there was pasture there for
        their flocks.

004:042 And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred
        men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah,
        and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.

004:043 And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped,
        and dwelt there unto this day.

005:001 Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was
        the firstborn; but forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed,
        his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of
        Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the
        birthright.

005:002 For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the
        chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)

005:003 The sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were,
        Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

005:004 The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his
        son,

005:005 Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,

005:006 Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried
        away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.

005:007 And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of
        their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and
        Zechariah,

005:008 And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel,
        who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:

005:009 And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the
        wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were
        multiplied in the land of Gilead.

005:010 And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who
        fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout
        all the east land of Gilead.

005:011 And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land
        of Bashan unto Salcah:

005:012 Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat
        in Bashan.

005:013 And their brethren of the house of their fathers were,
        Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and
        Zia, and Heber, seven.

005:014 These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of
        Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of
        Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;

005:015 Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of
        their fathers.

005:016 And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in
        all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.

005:017 All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham
        king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.

005:018 The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of
        Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword,
        and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty
        thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the
        war.

005:019 And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish,
        and Nodab.

005:020 And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were
        delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for
        they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them;
        because they put their trust in him.

005:021 And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty
        thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of
        asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.

005:022 For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God.
        And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.

005:023 And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the
        land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir,
        and unto mount Hermon.

005:024 And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even
        Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and
        Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and
        heads of the house of their fathers.

005:025 And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and
        went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom
        God destroyed before them.

005:026 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of
        Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria,
        and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the
        Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto
        Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this
        day.

006:001 The sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

006:002 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel.

006:003 And the children of Amram; Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam. The
        sons also of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

006:008 And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Ahimaaz,

006:009 And Ahimaaz begat Azariah, and Azariah begat Johanan,

006:010 And Johanan begat Azariah, (he it is that executed the
        priest's office in the temple that Solomon built in
        Jerusalem:)

006:011 And Azariah begat Amariah, and Amariah begat Ahitub,

006:012 And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Shallum,

006:013 And Shallum begat Hilkiah, and Hilkiah begat Azariah,

006:014 And Azariah begat Seraiah, and Seraiah begat Jehozadak,

006:015 And Jehozadak went into captivity, when the LORD carried away
        Judah and Jerusalem by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar.

006:016 The sons of Levi; Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.

006:017 And these be the names of the sons of Gershom; Libni, and
        Shimei.

006:018 And the sons of Kohath were, Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and
        Uzziel.

006:031 And these are they whom David set over the service of song in
        the house of the LORD, after that the ark had rest.

006:032 And they ministered before the dwelling place of the
        tabernacle of the congregation with singing, until Solomon had
        built the house of the LORD in Jerusalem: and then they waited
        on their office according to their order.

006:033 And these are they that waited with their children. Of the

006:049 But Aaron and his sons offered upon the altar of the burnt
        offering, and on the altar of incense, and were appointed for
        all the work of the place most holy, and to make an atonement

006:054 Now these are their dwelling places throughout their castles
        in their coasts, of the sons of Aaron, of the families of the
        Kohathites: for theirs was the lot.

006:055 And they gave them Hebron in the land of Judah, and the
        suburbs thereof round about it.

006:056 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, they

006:076 And out of the tribe of Naphtali; Kedesh in Galilee with her
        suburbs, and Hammon with her suburbs, and Kirjathaim with her

006:077 Unto the rest of the children of Merari were given out of the
        tribe of Zebulun, Rimmon with her suburbs, Tabor with her

007:001 Now the sons of Issachar were, Tola, and Puah, Jashub, and
        Shimrom, four.

007:002 And the sons of Tola; Uzzi, and Rephaiah, and Jeriel, and
        Jahmai, and Jibsam, and Shemuel, heads of their father's
        house, to wit, of Tola: they were valiant men of might in

007:003 And the sons of Uzzi; Izrahiah: and the sons of Izrahiah;
        Michael, and Obadiah, and Joel, Ishiah, five: all of them
        chief men.

007:004 And with them, by their generations, after the house of their
        fathers, were bands of soldiers for war, six and thirty
        thousand men: for they had many wives and sons.

007:005 And their brethren among all the families of Issachar were
        valiant men of might, reckoned in all by their genealogies
        fourscore and seven thousand.

007:007 And the sons of Bela; Ezbon, and Uzzi, and Uzziel, and
        Jerimoth, and Iri, five; heads of the house of their fathers,

007:008 And the sons of Becher; Zemira, and Joash, and Eliezer, and
        Elioenai, and Omri, and Jerimoth, and Abiah, and Anathoth, and
        Alameth. All these are the sons of Becher.

007:009 And the number of them, after their genealogy by their
        generations, heads of the house of their fathers, mighty men
        of valour, was twenty thousand and two hundred.

007:011 All these the sons of Jediael, by the heads of their fathers,
        mighty men of valour, were seventeen thousand and two hundred
        soldiers, fit to go out for war and battle.

        Shallum, the sons of Bilhah.

007:014 The sons of Manasseh; Ashriel, whom she bare: (but his
        concubine the Aramitess bare Machir the father of Gilead:

007:015 And Machir took to wife the sister of Huppim and Shuppim,
        whose sister's name was Maachah;) and the name of the second
        was Zelophehad: and Zelophehad had daughters.

007:016 And Maachah the wife of Machir bare a son, and she called his
        name Peresh; and the name of his brother was Sheresh; and his
        sons were Ulam and Rakem.

007:017 And the sons of Ulam; Bedan. These were the sons of Gilead,
        the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh.

007:018 And his sister Hammoleketh bare Ishod, and Abiezer, and
        Mahalah.

        Tahath his son, and Eladah his son, and Tahath his son,

007:021 And Zabad his son, and Shuthelah his son, and Ezer, and Elead,
        whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew, because
        they came down to take away their cattle.

007:022 And Ephraim their father mourned many days, and his brethren
        came to comfort him.

007:023 And when he went in to his wife, she conceived, and bare a
        son, and he called his name Beriah, because it went evil with
        his house.

007:024 (And his daughter was Sherah, who built Bethhoron the nether,
        and the upper, and Uzzensherah.)

007:025 And Rephah was his son, also Resheph, and Telah his son, and
        Tahan his son.

007:026 Laadan his son, Ammihud his son, Elishama his son.

        towns thereof, and eastward Naaran, and westward Gezer, with
        the towns thereof; Shechem also and the towns thereof, unto
        Gaza and the towns thereof:

007:029 And by the borders of the children of Manasseh, Bethshean and
        her towns, Taanach and her towns, Megiddo and her towns, Dor
        and her towns. In these dwelt the children of Joseph the son
        of Israel.

007:030 The sons of Asher; Imnah, and Isuah, and Ishuai, and Beriah,
        and Serah their sister.

007:031 And the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel, who is the father
        of Birzavith.

007:032 And Heber begat Japhlet, and Shomer, and Hotham, and Shua
        their sister.

007:033 And the sons of Japhlet; Pasach, and Bimhal, and Ashvath.
        These are the children of Japhlet.

007:034 And the sons of Shamer; Ahi, and Rohgah, Jehubbah, and Aram.

007:040 All these were the children of Asher, heads of their father's
        house, choice and mighty men of valour, chief of the princes.
        And the number throughout the genealogy of them that were apt
        to the war and to battle was twenty and six thousand men.

008:001 Now Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second, and
        Aharah the third,

008:002 Nohah the fourth, and Rapha the fifth.

008:003 And the sons of Bela were, Addar, and Gera, and Abihud,

008:004 And Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah,

008:005 And Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.

008:006 And these are the sons of Ehud: these are the heads of the
        fathers of the inhabitants of Geba, and they removed them to
        Manahath:

008:007 And Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera, he removed them, and begat
        Uzza, and Ahihud.

008:008 And Shaharaim begat children in the country of Moab, after he
        had sent them away; Hushim and Baara were his wives.

008:009 And he begat of Hodesh his wife, Jobab, and Zibia, and Mesha,
        and Malcham,

008:010 And Jeuz, and Shachia, and Mirma. These were his sons, heads
        of the fathers.

008:011 And of Hushim he begat Abitub, and Elpaal.

008:012 The sons of Elpaal; Eber, and Misham, and Shamed, who built
        Ono, and Lod, with the towns thereof:

008:013 Beriah also, and Shema, who were heads of the fathers of the
        inhabitants of Aijalon, who drove away the inhabitants of
        Gath:

008:014 And Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth,

008:015 And Zebadiah, and Arad, and Ader,

008:016 And Michael, and Ispah, and Joha, the sons of Beriah;

008:017 And Zebadiah, and Meshullam, and Hezeki, and Heber,

008:018 Ishmerai also, and Jezliah, and Jobab, the sons of Elpaal;

008:019 And Jakim, and Zichri, and Zabdi,

008:027 And Jaresiah, and Eliah, and Zichri, the sons of Jeroham.

008:028 These were heads of the fathers, by their generations, chief
        men. These dwelt in Jerusalem.

008:029 And at Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon; whose wife's name
        was Maachah:

008:030 And his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and
        Nadab,

008:031 And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zacher.

008:032 And Mikloth begat Shimeah. And these also dwelt with their
        brethren in Jerusalem, over against them.

008:033 And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul, and Saul begat
        Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

008:034 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal; and Meribbaal begat
        Micah.

008:035 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tarea, and
        Ahaz.

008:036 And Ahaz begat Jehoadah; and Jehoadah begat Alemeth, and
        Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza,

008:037 And Moza begat Binea: Rapha was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel
        his son:

008:038 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam,
        Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan.
        All these were the sons of Azel.

008:039 And the sons of Eshek his brother were, Ulam his firstborn,
        Jehush the second, and Eliphelet the third.

008:040 And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valour, archers, and
        had many sons, and sons' sons, an hundred and fifty. All these
        are of the sons of Benjamin.

009:001 So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they
        were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, who
        were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.

009:002 Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in
        their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and
        the Nethinims.

009:003 And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the
        children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and
        Manasseh;

009:004 Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri,
        the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah.

009:005 And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons.

009:006 And of the sons of Zerah; Jeuel, and their brethren, six
        hundred and ninety.

009:007 And of the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the
        son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah,

009:008 And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the
        son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephathiah, the son
        of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;

009:009 And their brethren, according to their generations, nine
        hundred and fifty and six. All these men were chief of the
        fathers in the house of their fathers.

009:010 And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,

009:011 And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son
        of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of
        the house of God;

009:012 And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of
        Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah,
        the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of
        Immer;

009:013 And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a
        thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for
        the work of the service of the house of God.

009:014 And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of
        Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;

009:015 And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of
        Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;

009:016 And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of
        Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah,
        that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.

009:017 And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and
        Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;

009:018 Who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward: they were
        porters in the companies of the children of Levi.

009:019 And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of
        Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the
        Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the
        gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the
        host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.

009:020 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in
        time past, and the LORD was with him.

009:021 And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation.

009:022 All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were
        two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy
        in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain
        in their set office.

009:023 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of
        the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by
        wards.

009:024 In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west,
        north, and south.

009:025 And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come
        after seven days from time to time with them.

009:026 For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set
        office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house
        of God.

009:027 And they lodged round about the house of God, because the
        charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning
        pertained to them.

009:028 And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels,
        that they should bring them in and out by tale.

009:029 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and
        all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and
        the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

009:030 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the
        spices.

009:031 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of
        Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that
        were made in the pans.

009:032 And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites,
        were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath.

009:033 And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the
        Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they
        were employed in that work day and night.

009:034 These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their
        generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.

009:035 And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's
        name was Maachah:

009:036 And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and
        Ner, and Nadab.

009:037 And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.

009:038 And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their
        brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.

009:039 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat
        Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

009:040 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat
        Micah.

009:041 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea,
        and Ahaz.

009:042 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth,
        and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;

009:043 And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son,
        Azel his son.

009:044 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam,
        Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan:
        these were the sons of Azel.

010:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of
        Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
        in mount Gilboa.

010:002 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his
        sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
        Malchishua, the sons of Saul.

010:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
        him, and he was wounded of the archers.

010:004 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
        me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse
        me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So
        Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

010:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
        likewise on the sword, and died.

010:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died
        together.

010:007 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw
        that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then
        they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came
        and dwelt in them.

010:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
        to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen
        in mount Gilboa.

010:009 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his
        armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about,
        to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.

010:010 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and
        fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.

010:011 And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had
        done to Saul,

010:012 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of
        Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh,
        and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted
        seven days.

010:013 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against
        the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept
        not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar
        spirit, to enquire of it;

010:014 And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and
        turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

011:001 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron,
        saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

011:002 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast
        he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy
        God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou
        shalt be ruler over my people Israel.

011:003 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron;
        and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD;
        and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the
        word of the LORD by Samuel.

011:004 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus;
        where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.

011:005 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not
        come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which
        is the city of David.

011:006 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be
        chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up,
        and was chief.

011:007 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the
        city of David.

011:008 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round
        about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

011:009 So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was
        with him.

011:010 These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who
        strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all
        Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD
        concerning Israel.

011:011 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had;
        Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted
        up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.

011:012 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who
        was one of the three mighties.

011:013 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were
        gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full
        of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.

011:014 And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and
        delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved
        them by a great deliverance.

011:015 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to
        David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the
        Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

011:016 And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison
        was then at Bethlehem.

011:017 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
        the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!

011:018 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and
        drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate,
        and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not
        drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.

011:019 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing:
        shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives
        in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought
        it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these
        three mightiest.

011:020 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three:
        for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them,
        and had a name among the three.

011:021 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was
        their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.

011:022 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of
        Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of
        Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy
        day.

011:023 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits
        high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's
        beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the
        spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own
        spear.

011:024 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
        among the three mighties.

011:025 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not
        to the first three: and David set him over his guard.

011:026 Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of
        Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

011:027 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

011:028 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,

011:029 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

011:030 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the
        Netophathite,

011:031 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the
        children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,

011:032 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,

011:033 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

011:034 The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the
        Hararite,

011:035 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,

011:036 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,

011:037 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,

011:038 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,

011:039 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of
        Joab the son of Zeruiah,

011:040 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

011:041 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,

011:042 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the
        Reubenites, and thirty with him,

011:043 Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,

011:044 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan
        the Aroerite,

011:045 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,

011:046 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of
        Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,

011:047 Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.

012:001 Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet
        kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they
        were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.

012:002 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand
        and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a
        bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.

012:003 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the
        Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and
        Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.

012:004 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and
        over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and
        Josabad the Gederathite,

012:005 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and
        Shephatiah the Haruphite,

012:006 Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam,
        the Korhites,

012:007 And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

012:008 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into
        the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit
        for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose
        faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the
        roes upon the mountains;

012:009 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,

012:010 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,

012:011 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

012:012 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

012:013 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.

012:014 These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of
        the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a
        thousand.

012:015 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when
        it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all
        them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the
        west.

012:016 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the
        hold unto David.

012:017 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto
        them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart
        shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine
        enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of
        our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.

012:018 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the
        captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side,
        thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to
        thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received
        them, and made them captains of the band.

012:019 And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with
        the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them
        not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him
        away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy
        of our heads.

012:020 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah,
        and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu,
        and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.

012:021 And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they
        were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.

012:022 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him,
        until it was a great host, like the host of God.

012:023 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed
        to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom
        of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.

012:024 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six
        thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.

012:025 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,
        seven thousand and one hundred.

012:026 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.

012:027 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him
        were three thousand and seven hundred;

012:028 And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's
        house twenty and two captains.

012:029 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three
        thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the
        ward of the house of Saul.

012:030 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight
        hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of
        their fathers.

012:031 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which
        were expressed by name, to come and make David king.

012:032 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had
        understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do;
        the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren
        were at their commandment.

012:033 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with
        all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank:
        they were not of double heart.

012:034 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield
        and spear thirty and seven thousand.

012:035 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and
        six hundred.

012:036 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war,
        forty thousand.

012:037 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the
        Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of
        instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty
        thousand.

012:038 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a
        perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel:
        and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make
        David king.

012:039 And there they were with David three days, eating and
        drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.

012:040 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and
        Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels,
        and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and
        bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep
        abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.

013:001 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and
        hundreds, and with every leader.

013:002 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem
        good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send
        abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the
        land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites
        which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather
        themselves unto us:

013:003 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we
        enquired not at it in the days of Saul.

013:004 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the
        thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

013:005 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt
        even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from
        Kirjathjearim.

013:006 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to
        Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the
        ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims,
        whose name is called on it.

013:007 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house
        of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.

013:008 And David and all Israel played before God with all their
        might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries,
        and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

013:009 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put
        forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

013:010 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he
        smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he
        died before God.

013:011 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
        upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this
        day.

013:012 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I
        bring the ark of God home to me?

013:013 So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of
        David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the
        Gittite.

013:014 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his
        house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of
        Obededom, and all that he had.

014:001 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of
        cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.

014:002 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over
        Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his
        people Israel.

014:003 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more
        sons and daughters.

014:004 Now these are the names of his children which he had in
        Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

014:005 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,

014:006 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

014:007 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.

014:008 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king
        over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David.
        And David heard of it, and went out against them.

014:009 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley
        of Rephaim.

014:010 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
        Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And
        the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into
        thine hand.

014:011 So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there.
        Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine
        hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called
        the name of that place Baalperazim.

014:012 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a
        commandment, and they were burned with fire.

014:013 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the
        valley.

014:014 Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him,
        Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them
        over against the mulberry trees.

014:015 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the
        tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to
        battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of
        the Philistines.

014:016 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the
        host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.

014:017 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD
        brought the fear of him upon all nations.

015:001 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a
        place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

015:002 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the
        Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of
        God, and to minister unto him for ever.

015:003 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring
        up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared
        for it.

015:004 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:

015:005 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an
        hundred and twenty:

015:006 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two
        hundred and twenty:

015:007 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an
        hundred and thirty:

015:008 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren
        two hundred:

015:009 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren
        fourscore:

015:010 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren
        an hundred and twelve.

015:011 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for
        the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel,
        and Amminadab,

015:012 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the
        Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that
        ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the
        place that I have prepared for it.

015:013 For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made
        a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due
        order.

015:014 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring
        up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.

015:015 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their
        shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded
        according to the word of the LORD.

015:016 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their
        brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick,
        psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the
        voice with joy.

015:017 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his
        brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of
        Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

015:018 And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah,
        Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni,
        Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and
        Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.

015:019 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to
        sound with cymbals of brass;

015:020 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and
        Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on
        Alamoth;

015:021 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and
        Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.

015:022 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he
        instructed about the song, because he was skilful.

015:023 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.

015:024 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
        Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow
        with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and
        Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

015:025 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over
        thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.

015:026 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the
        ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven
        bullocks and seven rams.

015:027 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the
        Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the
        master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him
        an ephod of linen.

015:028 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with
        trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and
        harps.

015:029 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul
        looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing:
        and she despised him in her heart.

016:001 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the
        tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt
        sacrifices and peace offerings before God.

016:002 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings
        and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of
        the LORD.

016:003 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to
        every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a
        flagon of wine.

016:004 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the
        ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the
        LORD God of Israel:

016:005 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and
        Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and
        Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with
        harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;

016:006 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets
        continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

016:007 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the
        LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

016:008 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his
        deeds among the people.

016:009 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his
        wondrous works.

016:010 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
        seek the LORD.

016:011 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

016:012 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,
        and the judgments of his mouth;

016:013 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his
        chosen ones.

016:014 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.

016:015 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he
        commanded to a thousand generations;

016:016 Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his
        oath unto Isaac;

016:017 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel
        for an everlasting covenant,

016:018 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
        your inheritance;

016:019 When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

016:020 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom
        to another people;

016:021 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
        for their sakes,

016:022 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

016:023 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day
        his salvation.

016:024 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works
        among all nations.

016:025 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is
        to be feared above all gods.

016:026 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made
        the heavens.

016:027 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness
        are in his place.

016:028 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
        LORD glory and strength.

016:029 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
        offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty
        of holiness.

016:030 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be
        stable, that it be not moved.

016:031 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let
        men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.

016:032 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields
        rejoice, and all that is therein.

016:033 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of
        the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.

016:034 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

016:035 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us
        together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give
        thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.

016:036 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all
        the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

016:037 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark
        continually, as every day's work required:

016:038 And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight;
        Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:

016:039 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the
        tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,

016:040 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the
        burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do
        according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which
        he commanded Israel;

016:041 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were
        chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the
        LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever;

016:042 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for
        those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments
        of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.

016:043 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David
        returned to bless his house.

017:001 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David
        said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars,
        but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under
        curtains.

017:002 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart;
        for God is with thee.

017:003 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came
        to Nathan, saying,

017:004 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt
        not build me an house to dwell in:

017:005 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought
        up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and
        from one tabernacle to another.

017:006 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to
        any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my
        people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?

017:007 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
        saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even
        from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my
        people Israel:

017:008 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and
        have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made
        thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the
        earth.

017:009 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will
        plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be
        moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste
        them any more, as at the beginning,

017:010 And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
        people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.
        Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an
        house.

017:011 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou
        must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed
        after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish
        his kingdom.

017:012 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for
        ever.

017:013 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not
        take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was
        before thee:

017:014 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for
        ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.

017:015 According to all these words, and according to all this
        vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

017:016 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who
        am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast
        brought me hitherto?

017:017 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou
        hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to
        come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of
        high degree, O LORD God.

017:018 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy
        servant? for thou knowest thy servant.

017:019 O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own
        heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all
        these great things.

017:020 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God
        beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our
        ears.

017:021 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel,
        whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a
        name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations
        from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?

017:022 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for
        ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.

017:023 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken
        concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established
        for ever, and do as thou hast said.

017:024 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for
        ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a
        God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be
        established before thee.

017:025 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build
        him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to
        pray before thee.

017:026 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness
        unto thy servant:

017:027 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy
        servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou
        blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.

018:001 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the
        Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out
        of the hand of the Philistines.

018:002 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants,
        and brought gifts.

018:003 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he
        went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

018:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven
        thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also
        houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an
        hundred chariots.

018:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king
        of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand
        men.

018:006 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians
        became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD
        preserved David whithersoever he went.

018:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
        of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

018:008 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,
        brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the
        brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

018:009 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all
        the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;

018:010 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his
        welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought
        against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war
        with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and
        silver and brass.

018:011 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver
        and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from
        Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from
        the Philistines, and from Amalek.

018:012 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in
        the valley of salt eighteen thousand.

018:013 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became
        David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever
        he went.

018:014 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and
        justice among all his people.

018:015 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud, recorder.

018:016 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of
        Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

018:017 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and
        the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the
        king.

019:001 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the
        children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.

019:002 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
        Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David
        sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the
        servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon
        to Hanun, to comfort him.

019:003 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun,
        Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath
        sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee
        for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?

019:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and
        cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks,
        and sent them away.

019:005 Then there went certain, and told David how the men were
        served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly
        ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards
        be grown, and then return.

019:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made
        themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon
        sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and
        horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out
        of Zobah.

019:007 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king
        of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba.
        And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from
        their cities, and came to battle.

019:008 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of
        the mighty men.

019:009 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
        array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were
        come were by themselves in the field.

019:010 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before
        and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put
        them in array against the Syrians.

019:011 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of
        Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against
        the children of Ammon.

019:012 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
        shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
        thee, then I will help thee.

019:013 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for
        our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do
        that which is good in his sight.

019:014 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the
        Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.

019:015 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
        they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered
        into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

019:016 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse
        before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the
        Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain
        of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

019:017 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed
        over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array
        against them. So when David had put the battle in array
        against the Syrians, they fought with him.

019:018 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the
        Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty
        thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

019:019 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to
        the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and
        became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the
        children of Ammon any more.

020:001 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the
        time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of
        the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and
        came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And
        Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.

020:002 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and
        found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious
        stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought
        also exceeding much spoil out of the city.

020:003 And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them
        with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so
        dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And
        David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

020:004 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer
        with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite
        slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they
        were subdued.

020:005 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the
        son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,
        whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.

020:006 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great
        stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on
        each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the
        giant.

020:007 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's
        brother slew him.

020:008 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the
        hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

021:001 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to
        number Israel.

021:002 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,
        number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number
        of them to me, that I may know it.

021:003 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times
        so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not
        all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this
        thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?

021:004 Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore
        Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to
        Jerusalem.

021:005 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David.
        And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred
        thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred
        threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.

021:006 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the
        king's word was abominable to Joab.

021:007 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
        Israel.

021:008 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have
        done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity
        of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

021:009 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,

021:010 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee
        three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto
        thee.

021:011 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
        Choose thee

021:012 Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed
        before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies
        overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD,
        even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD
        destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore
        advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent
        me.

021:013 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall
        now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies:
        but let me not fall into the hand of man.

021:014 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of
        Israel seventy thousand men.

021:015 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he
        was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the
        evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay
        now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the
        threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

021:016 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD
        stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword
        in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the
        elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon
        their faces.

021:017 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people
        to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil
        indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine
        hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's
        house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.

021:018 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that
        David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the
        threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

021:019 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the
        name of the LORD.

021:020 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons
        with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.

021:021 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and
        went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David
        with his face to the ground.

021:022 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this
        threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the
        LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the
        plague may be stayed from the people.

021:023 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord
        the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee
        the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing
        instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I
        give it all.

021:024 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it
        for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine
        for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.

021:025 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of
        gold by weight.

021:026 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered
        burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD;
        and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of
        burnt offering.

021:027 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword
        again into the sheath thereof.

021:028 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in
        the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed
        there.

021:029 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the
        wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that
        season in the high place at Gibeon.

021:030 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was
        afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

022:001 Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this
        is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.

022:002 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were
        in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones
        to build the house of God.

022:003 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the
        doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in
        abundance without weight;

022:004 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of
        Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.

022:005 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the
        house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding
        magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I
        will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared
        abundantly before his death.

022:006 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build
        an house for the LORD God of Israel.

022:007 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my
        mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:

022:008 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed
        blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not
        build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood
        upon the earth in my sight.

022:009 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of
        rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round
        about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace
        and quietness unto Israel in his days.

022:010 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son,
        and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of
        his kingdom over Israel for ever.

022:011 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and
        build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.

022:012 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give
        thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law
        of the LORD thy God.

022:013 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the
        statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with
        concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not,
        nor be dismayed.

022:014 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of
        the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand
        thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without
        weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I
        prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.

022:015 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and
        workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for
        every manner of work.

022:016 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is
        no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with
        thee.

022:017 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon
        his son, saying,

022:018 Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you
        rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the
        land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD,
        and before his people.

022:019 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;
        arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God,
        to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy
        vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name
        of the LORD.

023:001 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his
        son king over Israel.

023:002 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the
        priests and the Levites.

023:003 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
        upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was
        thirty and eight thousand.

023:004 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the
        work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers
        and judges:

023:005 Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised
        the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to
        praise therewith.

023:006 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,
        namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

023:007 Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.

023:008 The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and
        Joel, three.

023:009 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.
        These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.

023:010 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and
        Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.

023:011 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and
        Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one
        reckoning, according to their father's house.

023:012 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

023:013 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated,
        that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons
        for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto
        him, and to bless in his name for ever.

023:014 Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of
        the tribe of Levi.

023:015 The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.

023:016 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.

023:017 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer
        had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

023:018 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.

023:019 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
        Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

023:020 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.

023:021 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli;
        Eleazar, and Kish.

023:022 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their
        brethren the sons of Kish took them.

023:023 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.

023:024 These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;
        even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number
        of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of
        the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and
        upward.

023:025 For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto
        his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:

023:026 And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the
        tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.

023:027 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from
        twenty years old and above:

023:028 Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the
        service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the
        chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the
        work of the service of the house of God;

023:029 Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat
        offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is
        baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all
        manner of measure and size;

023:030 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and
        likewise at even:

023:031 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the
        sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number,
        according to the order commanded unto them, continually before
        the LORD:

023:032 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge
        of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the
        house of the LORD.

024:001 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of
        Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

024:002 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no
        children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's
        office.

024:003 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,
        and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their
        offices in their service.

024:004 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar
        than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among
        the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house
        of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar
        according to the house of their fathers.

024:005 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
        governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God,
        were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

024:006 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the
        Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and
        Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and
        before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites:
        one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken
        for Ithamar.

024:007 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to
        Jedaiah,

024:008 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

024:009 The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

024:010 The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,

024:011 The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah,

024:012 The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,

024:013 The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

024:014 The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,

024:015 The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses,

024:016 The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,

024:017 The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to
        Gamul,

024:018 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to
        Maaziah.

024:019 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into
        the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron
        their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.

024:020 And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of
        Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.

024:021 Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was
        Isshiah.

024:022 Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.

024:023 And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
        Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.

024:024 Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.

024:025 The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah;
        Zechariah.

024:026 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah;
        Beno.

024:027 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur,
        and Ibri.

024:028 Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.

024:029 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.

024:030 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These
        were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.

024:031 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons
        of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and
        Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and
        Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger
        brethren.

025:001 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the
        service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun,
        who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with
        cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their
        service was:

025:002 Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and
        Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which
        prophesied according to the order of the king.

025:003 Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and
        Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of
        their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give
        thanks and to praise the LORD.

025:004 Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel,
        Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti,
        and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and
        Mahazioth:

025:005 All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words
        of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen
        sons and three daughters.

025:006 All these were under the hands of their father for song in the
        house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for
        the service of the house of God, according to the king's order
        to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.

025:007 So the number of them, with their brethren that were
        instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were
        cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.

025:008 And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as
        the great, the teacher as the scholar.

025:009 Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second
        to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve:

025:010 The third to Zaccur, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

        were twelve:

        were twelve:

        were twelve:

        were twelve:

025:026 The nineteenth to Mallothi, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:027 The twentieth to Eliathah, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

        brethren, were twelve:

        brethren, were twelve:

025:031 The four and twentieth to Romamtiezer, he, his sons, and his
        brethren, were twelve.

026:001 Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was
        Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.

026:002 And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn,
        Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

026:003 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.

026:004 Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn,
        Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth,
        and Nethaneel the fifth.

026:005 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth:
        for God blessed him.

026:006 Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled
        throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men
        of valour.

026:007 The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad,
        whose brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.

026:008 All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and
        their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were
        threescore and two of Obededom.

026:009 And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.

026:010 Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the
        chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father
        made him the chief;)

026:011 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth:
        all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.

026:012 Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the
        chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in
        the house of the LORD.

026:013 And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according
        to the house of their fathers, for every gate.

026:014 And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his
        son, a wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out
        northward.

026:015 To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.

026:016 To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the
        gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward
        against ward.

026:017 Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward
        four a day, and toward Asuppim two and two.

026:018 At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.

026:019 These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore,
        and among the sons of Merari.

026:020 And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house
        of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.

026:021 As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite
        Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite, were
        Jehieli.

026:022 The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were
        over the treasures of the house of the LORD.

026:023 Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the
        Uzzielites:

026:024 And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of
        the treasures.

026:025 And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah
        his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith
        his son.

026:026 Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures
        of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief
        fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the
        captains of the host, had dedicated.

026:027 Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain
        the house of the LORD.

026:028 And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and
        Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had
        dedicated; and whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under
        the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren.

026:029 Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward
        business over Israel, for officers and judges.

026:030 And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of
        valour, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them
        of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of
        the LORD, and in the service of the king.

026:031 Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the
        Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In
        the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for,
        and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer
        of Gilead.

026:032 And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven
        hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the
        Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for
        every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.

027:001 Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the
        chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and
        their officers that served the king in any matter of the
        courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout
        all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and
        four thousand.

027:002 Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the
        son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four
        thousand.

027:003 Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of
        the host for the first month.

        Anetothite, of the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty
        and four thousand.

        Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and
        four thousand.

027:016 Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the
        Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites,
        Shephatiah the son of Maachah:

027:022 Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of
        the tribes of Israel.

027:023 But David took not the number of them from twenty years old
        and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel
        like to the stars of the heavens.

027:024 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not,
        because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was
        the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.

027:025 And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel:
        and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in
        the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of
        Uzziah:

027:026 And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of
        the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:

027:027 And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the
        increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the
        Shiphmite:

027:028 And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in
        the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the
        cellars of oil was Joash:

027:029 And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the
        Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was
        Shaphat the son of Adlai:

027:030 Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the
        asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:

027:031 And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the
        rulers of the substance which was king David's.

027:032 Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and
        a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's
        sons:

027:033 And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor: and Hushai the
        Archite was the king's companion:

027:034 And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and
        Abiathar: and the general of the king's army was Joab.

028:001 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of
        the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered
        to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands,
        and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the
        substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with
        the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the
        valiant men, unto Jerusalem.

028:002 Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me,
        my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to
        build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for
        the building:

028:003 But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my
        name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed
        blood.

028:004 Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house
        of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath
        chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the
        house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked
        me to make me king over all Israel:

028:005 And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he
        hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the
        kingdom of the LORD over Israel.

028:006 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house
        and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will
        be his father.

028:007 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be
        constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this
        day.

028:008 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of
        the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for
        all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess
        this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your
        children after you for ever.

028:009 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and
        serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for
        the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the
        imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be
        found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off
        for ever.

028:010 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house
        for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

028:011 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch,
        and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and
        of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours
        thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,

028:012 And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the
        courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round
        about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the
        treasuries of the dedicated things:

028:013 Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for
        all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for
        all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.

028:014 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all
        instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all
        instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every
        kind of service:

028:015 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their
        lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the
        lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight,
        both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof,
        according to the use of every candlestick.

028:016 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for
        every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:

028:017 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the
        cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for
        every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of
        silver:

028:018 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold
        for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread
        out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD.

028:019 All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing
        by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.

028:020 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good
        courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD
        God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee,
        nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for
        the service of the house of the LORD.

028:021 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even
        they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of
        God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of
        workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of
        service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at
        thy commandment.

029:001 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,
        Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and
        tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man,
        but for the LORD God.

029:002 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God
        the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for
        things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron
        for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones,
        and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers
        colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones
        in abundance.

029:003 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my
        God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which
        I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I
        have prepared for the holy house.

029:004 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and
        seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls
        of the houses withal:

029:005 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of
        silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of
        artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service
        this day unto the LORD?

029:006 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of
        Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the
        rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,

029:007 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five
        thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten
        thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and
        one hundred thousand talents of iron.

029:008 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
        treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the
        Gershonite.

029:009 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,
        because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD:
        and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

029:010 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:
        and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our
        father, for ever and ever.

029:011 Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
        and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the
        heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O
        LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.

029:012 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over
        all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand
        it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.

029:013 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious
        name.

029:014 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to
        offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of
        thee, and of thine own have we given thee.

029:015 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all
        our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there
        is none abiding.

029:016 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build
        thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is
        all thine own.

029:017 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast
        pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine
        heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have
        I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer
        willingly unto thee.

029:018 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep
        this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart
        of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:

029:019 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy
        commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all
        these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have
        made provision.

029:020 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD
        your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of
        their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the
        LORD, and the king.

029:021 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered
        burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day,
        even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand
        lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance
        for all Israel:

029:022 And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great
        gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the
        second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief
        governor, and Zadok to be priest.

029:023 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of
        David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

029:024 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons
        likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the
        king.

029:025 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
        Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not
        been on any king before him in Israel.

029:026 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.

029:027 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years;
        seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
        reigned he in Jerusalem.

029:028 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and
        honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

029:029 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they
        are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of
        Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,

029:030 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over
        him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the
        countries.

Book 14	2 Chronicles

001:001 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,
        and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him
        exceedingly.

001:002 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of
        thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every
        governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.

001:003 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the
        high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of
        the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD
        had made in the wilderness.

001:004 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to
        the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched
        a tent for it at Jerusalem.

001:005 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the
        son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the
        LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.

001:006 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the
        LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and
        offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.

001:007 In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him,
        Ask what I shall give thee.

001:008 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto
        David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.

001:009 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be
        established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the
        dust of the earth in multitude.

001:010 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come
        in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that
        is so great?

001:011 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and
        thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of
        thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast
        asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge
        my people, over whom I have made thee king:

001:012 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give
        thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings
        have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any
        after thee have the like.

001:013 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was
        at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and reigned over Israel.

001:014 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a
        thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
        horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the
        king at Jerusalem.

001:015 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
        stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are
        in the vale for abundance.

001:016 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
        the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

001:017 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot
        for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred
        and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of
        the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.

002:001 And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the
        LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

002:002 And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
        burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and
        three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.

002:003 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou
        didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to
        build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.

002:004 Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to
        dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and
        for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings
        morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
        and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an
        ordinance for ever to Israel.

002:005 And the house which I build is great: for great is our God
        above all gods.

002:006 But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and
        heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I
        should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before
        him?

002:007 Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in
        silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson,
        and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men
        that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my
        father did provide.

002:008 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of
        Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber
        in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy
        servants,

002:009 Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I
        am about to build shall be wonderful great.

002:010 And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut
        timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty
        thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of
        wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.

002:011 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent
        to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath
        made thee king over them.

002:012 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that
        made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise
        son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build
        an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

002:013 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding,
        of Huram my father's,

002:014 The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was
        a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in
        brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue,
        and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of
        graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to
        him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord
        David thy father.

002:015 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the
        wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his
        servants:

002:016 And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt
        need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa;
        and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.

002:017 And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land
        of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had
        numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty
        thousand and three thousand and six hundred.

002:018 And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers
        of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the
        mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set
        the people a work.

003:001 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem
        in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his
        father, in the place that David had prepared in the
        threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

003:002 And he began to build in the second day of the second month,
        in the fourth year of his reign.

003:003 Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for
        the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after
        the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth
        twenty cubits.

003:004 And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length
        of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty
        cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he
        overlaid it within with pure gold.

003:005 And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he
        overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and
        chains.

003:006 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty:
        and the gold was gold of Parvaim.

003:007 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the
        walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved
        cherubims on the walls.

003:008 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was
        according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the
        breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine
        gold, amounting to six hundred talents.

003:009 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he
        overlaid the upper chambers with gold.

003:010 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image
        work, and overlaid them with gold.

003:011 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one
        wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall
        of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits,
        reaching to the wing of the other cherub.

003:012 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to
        the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits
        also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.

003:013 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty
        cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were
        inward.

003:014 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and
        fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.

003:015 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five
        cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of
        them was five cubits.

003:016 And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the
        heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and
        put them on the chains.

003:017 And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the
        right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of
        that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the
        left Boaz.

004:001 Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
        thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits
        the height thereof.

004:002 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
        round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a
        line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

004:003 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it
        round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about.
        Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.

004:004 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
        three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
        south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set
        above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.

004:005 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it
        like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies;
        and it received and held three thousand baths.

004:006 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and
        five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered
        for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was
        for the priests to wash in.

004:007 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form,
        and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five
        on the left.

004:008 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five
        on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an
        hundred basons of gold.

004:009 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great
        court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them
        with brass.

004:010 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over
        against the south.

004:011 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And
        Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon
        for the house of God;

004:012 To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters
        which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths
        to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the
        top of the pillars;

004:013 And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of
        pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the
        chapiters which were upon the pillars.

004:014 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;

004:015 One sea, and twelve oxen under it.

004:016 The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all
        their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon
        for the house of the LORD of bright brass.

004:017 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
        ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.

004:018 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for
        the weight of the brass could not be found out.

004:019 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of
        God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the
        shewbread was set;

004:020 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should
        burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;

004:021 And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of
        gold, and that perfect gold;

004:022 And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the
        censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner
        doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the
        house of the temple, were of gold.

005:001 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD
        was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David
        his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and
        all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house
        of God.

005:002 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
        of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
        Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of
        the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.

005:003 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the
        king in the feast which was in the seventh month.

005:004 And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the
        ark.

005:005 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
        tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.

005:006 Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that
        were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and
        oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

005:007 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy
        place, even under the wings of the cherubims:

005:008 For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of
        the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
        thereof above.

005:009 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
        staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were
        not seen without. And there it is unto this day.

005:010 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses
        put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the
        children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

005:011 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
        holy place: (for all the priests that were present were
        sanctified, and did not then wait by course:

005:012 Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph,
        of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren,
        being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries
        and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them
        an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)

005:013 It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as
        one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking
        the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the
        trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised
        the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for
        ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the
        house of the LORD;

005:014 So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of
        the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of
        God.

006:001 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in
        the thick darkness.

006:002 But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place
        for thy dwelling for ever.

006:003 And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole
        congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel
        stood.

006:004 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with
        his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my
        father David, saying,

006:005 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land
        of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to
        build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose
        I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:

006:006 But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and
        have chosen David to be over my people Israel.

006:007 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
        for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

006:008 But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in
        thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in
        that it was in thine heart:

006:009 Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son
        which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the
        house for my name.

006:010 The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath
        spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and
        am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have
        built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

006:011 And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the
        LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.

006:012 And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of
        all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:

006:013 For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long,
        and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it
        in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled
        down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and
        spread forth his hands toward heaven.

006:014 And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in
        the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and
        shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with
        all their hearts:

006:015 Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that
        which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and
        hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.

006:016 Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant
        David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying,
        There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the
        throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their
        way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.

006:017 Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified,
        which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.

006:018 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,
        heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much
        less this house which I have built!

006:019 Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to
        his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
        the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:

006:020 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,
        upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put
        thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant
        prayeth toward this place.

006:021 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and
        of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place:
        hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when
        thou hearest, forgive.

006:022 If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon
        him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in
        this house;

006:023 Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by
        requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own
        head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according
        to his righteousness.

006:024 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
        because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and
        confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee
        in this house;

006:025 Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy
        people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou
        gavest to them and to their fathers.

006:026 When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
        have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place,
        and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost
        afflict them;

006:027 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy
        servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them
        the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy
        land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an
        inheritance.

006:028 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if
        there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if
        their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land;
        whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:

006:029 Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of
        any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall
        know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth
        his hands in this house:

006:030 Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive,
        and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose
        heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the
        children of men:)

006:031 That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they
        live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

006:032 Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people
        Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's
        sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they
        come and pray in this house;

006:033 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place,
        and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for;
        that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee,
        as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which
        I have built is called by thy name.

006:034 If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way
        that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this
        city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built
        for thy name;

006:035 Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their
        supplication, and maintain their cause.

006:036 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth
        not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over
        before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a
        land far off or near;

006:037 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are
        carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of
        their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss,
        and have dealt wickedly;

006:038 If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their
        soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried
        them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest
        unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast
        chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:

006:039 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place,
        their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their
        cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee.

006:040 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let
        thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this
        place.

006:041 Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou,
        and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be
        clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in
        goodness.

006:042 O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember
        the mercies of David thy servant.

007:001 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came
        down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the
        sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.

007:002 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,
        because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.

007:003 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came
        down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed
        themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement,
        and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good;
        for his mercy endureth for ever.

007:004 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
        LORD.

007:005 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two
        thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so
        the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.

007:006 And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
        instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had
        made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever,
        when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded
        trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.

007:007 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was
        before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt
        offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the
        brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive
        the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.

007:008 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and
        all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the
        entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.

007:009 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they
        kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast
        seven days.

007:010 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he
        sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart
        for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to
        Solomon, and to Israel his people.

007:011 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's
        house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the
        house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously
        effected.

007:012 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him,
        I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself
        for an house of sacrifice.

007:013 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the
        locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my
        people;

007:014 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
        themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
        wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive
        their sin, and will heal their land.

007:015 Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the
        prayer that is made in this place.

007:016 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name
        may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be
        there perpetually.

007:017 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy
        father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded
        thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;

007:018 Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I
        have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not
        fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.

007:019 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my
        commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and
        serve other gods, and worship them;

007:020 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I
        have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for
        my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a
        proverb and a byword among all nations.

007:021 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to
        every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath
        the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?

007:022 And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of
        their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of
        Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and
        served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon
        them.

008:001 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein
        Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,

008:002 That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon
        built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.

008:003 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.

008:004 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store
        cities, which he built in Hamath.

008:005 Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,
        fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;

008:006 And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and
        all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and
        all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in
        Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.

008:007 As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the
        Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
        Jebusites, which were not of Israel,

008:008 But of their children, who were left after them in the land,
        whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon
        make to pay tribute until this day.

008:009 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for
        his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains,
        and captains of his chariots and horsemen.

008:010 And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two
        hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.

008:011 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city
        of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he
        said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of
        Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the
        LORD hath come.

008:012 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the
        altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,

008:013 Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the
        commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
        and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the
        feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in
        the feast of tabernacles.

008:014 And he appointed, according to the order of David his father,
        the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites
        to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests,
        as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their
        courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God
        commanded.

008:015 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto
        the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning
        the treasures.

008:016 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
        foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was
        finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.

008:017 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side
        in the land of Edom.

008:018 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and
        servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the
        servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and
        fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

009:001 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she
        came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a
        very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in
        abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to
        Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.

009:002 And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing
        hid from Solomon which he told her not.

009:003 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon,
        and the house that he had built,

009:004 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
        and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his
        cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he
        went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit
        in her.

009:005 And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard
        in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:

009:006 Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine
        eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness
        of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame
        that I heard.

009:007 Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which
        stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.

009:008 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set
        thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because
        thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore
        made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.

009:009 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
        and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither
        was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king
        Solomon.

009:010 And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,
        which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and
        precious stones.

009:011 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of
        the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries
        for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land
        of Judah.

009:012 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
        whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto
        the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she
        and her servants.

009:013 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
        six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;

009:014 Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the
        kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and
        silver to Solomon.

009:015 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
        hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.

009:016 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three
        hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put
        them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.

009:017 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
        it with pure gold.

009:018 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of
        gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each
        side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the
        stays:

009:019 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
        upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any
        kingdom.

009:020 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and
        all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of
        pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted
        of in the days of Solomon.

009:021 For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of
        Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish
        bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

009:022 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches
        and wisdom.

009:023 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon,
        to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.

009:024 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
        vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and
        mules, a rate year by year.

009:025 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots,
        and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot
        cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

009:026 And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the
        land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.

009:027 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar
        trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains
        in abundance.

009:028 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of
        all lands.

009:029 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they
        not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the
        prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo
        the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

009:030 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

009:031 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the
        city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
        stead.

010:001 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel
        come to make him king.

010:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
        in Egypt, whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the
        king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.

010:003 And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came
        and spake to Rehoboam, saying,

010:004 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou
        somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy
        yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.

010:005 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days.
        And the people departed.

010:006 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
        before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What
        counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?

010:007 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this
        people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they
        will be thy servants for ever.

010:008 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and
        took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him,
        that stood before him.

010:009 And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return
        answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease
        somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?

010:010 And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto
        him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto
        thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it
        somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My
        little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

010:011 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put
        more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I
        will chastise you with scorpions.

010:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third
        day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third
        day.

010:013 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
        the counsel of the old men,

010:014 And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying,
        My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my
        father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with
        scorpions.

010:015 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was
        of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake
        by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of
        Nebat.

010:016 And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
        them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have
        we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse:
        every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to
        thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.

010:017 But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of
        Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

010:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and
        the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.
        But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to
        flee to Jerusalem.

010:019 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

011:001 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the
        house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand
        chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that
        he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.

011:002 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God,
        saying,

011:003 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to
        all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,

011:004 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
        your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing
        is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and
        returned from going against Jeroboam.

011:005 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence
        in Judah.

011:006 He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

011:007 And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,

011:008 And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,

011:009 And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,

011:010 And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in
        Benjamin fenced cities.

011:011 And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them,
        and store of victual, and of oil and wine.

011:012 And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made
        them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.

011:013 And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel
        resorted to him out of all their coasts.

011:014 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and
        came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had
        cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the
        LORD:

011:015 And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the
        devils, and for the calves which he had made.

011:016 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set
        their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem,
        to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.

011:017 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam
        the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they
        walked in the way of David and Solomon.

011:018 And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the
        son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the
        son of Jesse;

011:019 Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.

011:020 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which
        bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.

011:021 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all
        his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and
        threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and
        threescore daughters.)

011:022 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be
        ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.

011:023 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children
        throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every
        fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he
        desired many wives.

012:001 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the
        kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of
        the LORD, and all Israel with him.

012:002 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam
        Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they
        had transgressed against the LORD,

012:003 With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand
        horsemen: and the people were without number that came with
        him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the
        Ethiopians.

012:004 And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and
        came to Jerusalem.

012:005 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes
        of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of
        Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have
        forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of
        Shishak.

012:006 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled
        themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.

012:007 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word
        of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled
        themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will
        grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured
        out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

012:008 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my
        service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.

012:009 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took
        away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures
        of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the
        shields of gold which Solomon had made.

012:010 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
        committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that
        kept the entrance of the king's house.

012:011 And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the
        guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the
        guard chamber.

012:012 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from
        him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in
        Judah things went well.

012:013 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and
        reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he
        began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem,
        the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of
        Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was
        Naamah an Ammonitess.

012:014 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the
        LORD.

012:015 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written
        in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer
        concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam
        and Jeroboam continually.

012:016 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
        city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

013:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to
        reign over Judah.

013:002 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
        was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was
        war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

013:003 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men
        of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also
        set the battle in array against him with eight hundred
        thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.

013:004 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount
        Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;

013:005 Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the
        kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his
        sons by a covenant of salt?

013:006 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son
        of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.

013:007 And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of
        Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the
        son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and
        could not withstand them.

013:008 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the
        hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and
        there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for
        gods.

013:009 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of
        Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the
        manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh
        to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the
        same may be a priest of them that are no gods.

013:010 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken
        him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the
        sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:

013:011 And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening
        burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set
        they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold
        with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the
        charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.

013:012 And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his
        priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O
        children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your
        fathers; for ye shall not prosper.

013:013 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them:
        so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.

013:014 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
        behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded
        with the trumpets.

013:015 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah
        shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all
        Israel before Abijah and Judah.

013:016 And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God
        delivered them into their hand.

013:017 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so
        there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen
        men.

013:018 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time,
        and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon
        the LORD God of their fathers.

013:019 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
        Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns
        thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.

013:020 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of
        Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.

013:021 But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat
        twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.

013:022 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his
        sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.

014:001 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
        city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his
        days the land was quiet ten years.

014:002 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the
        LORD his God:

014:003 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high
        places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:

014:004 And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and
        to do the law and the commandment.

014:005 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high
        places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.

014:006 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest,
        and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given
        him rest.

014:007 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and
        make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the
        land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our
        God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every
        side. So they built and prospered.

014:008 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out
        of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that
        bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore
        thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.

014:009 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an
        host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and
        came unto Mareshah.

014:010 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in
        array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.

014:011 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is
        nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them
        that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on
        thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD,
        thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.

014:012 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
        and the Ethiopians fled.

014:013 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto
        Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not
        recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD,
        and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.

014:014 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear
        of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities;
        for there was exceeding much spoil in them.

014:015 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep
        and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.

015:001 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:

015:002 And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me,
        Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while
        ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you;
        but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.

015:003 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God,
        and without a teaching priest, and without law.

015:004 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of
        Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.

015:005 And in those times there was no peace to him that went out,
        nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the
        inhabitants of the countries.

015:006 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God
        did vex them with all adversity.

015:007 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for
        your work shall be rewarded.

015:008 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the
        prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols
        out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the
        cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the
        altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.

015:009 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with
        them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they
        fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the
        LORD his God was with him.

015:010 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third
        month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

015:011 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil
        which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand
        sheep.

015:012 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their
        fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;

015:013 That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be
        put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.

015:014 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with
        shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.

015:015 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with
        all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and
        he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.

015:016 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he
        removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in
        a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt
        it at the brook Kidron.

015:017 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
        nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

015:018 And he brought into the house of God the things that his
        father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated,
        silver, and gold, and vessels.

015:019 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of
        the reign of Asa.

016:001 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king
        of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the
        intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of
        Judah.

016:002 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of
        the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to
        Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

016:003 There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my
        father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and
        gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he
        may depart from me.

016:004 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
        his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon,
        and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

016:005 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off
        building of Ramah, and let his work cease.

016:006 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
        stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was
        building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.

016:007 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,
        and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of
        Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the
        host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.

016:008 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very
        many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on
        the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.

016:009 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
        earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose
        heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly:
        therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.

016:010 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison
        house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing.
        And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.

016:011 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are
        written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

016:012 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
        in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his
        disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.

016:013 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and
        fortieth year of his reign.

016:014 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made
        for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed
        which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices
        prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great
        burning for him.

017:001 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened
        himself against Israel.

017:002 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and
        set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of
        Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.

017:003 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the
        first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;

017:004 But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his
        commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.

017:005 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all
        Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and
        honour in abundance.

017:006 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover
        he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.

017:007 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes,
        even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to
        Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.

017:008 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah,
        and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and
        Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them
        Elishama and Jehoram, priests.

017:009 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the
        LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of
        Judah, and taught the people.

017:010 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the
        lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war
        against Jehoshaphat.

017:011 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and
        tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven
        thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven
        hundred he goats.

017:012 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
        castles, and cities of store.

017:013 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men
        of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.

017:014 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of
        their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the
        chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred
        thousand.

017:015 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two
        hundred and fourscore thousand.

017:016 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly
        offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred
        thousand mighty men of valour.

017:017 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him
        armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.

017:018 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and
        fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.

017:019 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in
        the fenced cities throughout all Judah.

018:001 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined
        affinity with Ahab.

018:002 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And
        Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the
        people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with
        him to Ramothgilead.

018:003 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
        Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I
        am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be
        with thee in the war.

018:004 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
        thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

018:005 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets
        four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to
        Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go
        up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.

018:006 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
        besides, that we might enquire of him?

018:007 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
        man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for
        he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is
        Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the
        king say so.

018:008 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and
        said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

018:009 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat
        either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they
        sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria;
        and all the prophets prophesied before them.

018:010 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,
        and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push
        Syria until they be consumed.

018:011 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
        Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into
        the hand of the king.

018:012 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,
        saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the
        king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be
        like one of their's, and speak thou good.

018:013 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith,
        that will I speak.

018:014 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,
        Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I
        forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be
        delivered into your hand.

018:015 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee
        that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the
        LORD?

018:016 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the
        mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said,
        These have no master; let them return therefore every man to
        his house in peace.

018:017 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
        thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?

018:018 Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the
        LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven
        standing on his right hand and on his left.

018:019 And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that
        he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying
        after this manner, and another saying after that manner.

018:020 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
        said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him,
        Wherewith?

018:021 And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth
        of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him,
        and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.

018:022 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
        mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil
        against thee.

018:023 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote
        Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of
        the LORD from me to speak unto thee?

018:024 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou
        shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

018:025 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him
        back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
        son;

018:026 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
        and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
        affliction, until I return in peace.

018:027 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath
        not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye
        people.

018:028 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
        up to Ramothgilead.

018:029 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
        myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy
        robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went
        to the battle.

018:030 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the
        chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small
        or great, save only with the king of Israel.

018:031 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
        Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel.
        Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat
        cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to
        depart from him.

018:032 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
        perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back
        again from pursuing him.

018:033 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
        of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said
        to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me
        out of the host; for I am wounded.

018:034 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel
        stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the
        even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.

019:001 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in
        peace to Jerusalem.

019:002 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
        said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and
        love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee
        from before the LORD.

019:003 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou
        hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared
        thine heart to seek God.

019:004 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again
        through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and
        brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.

019:005 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities
        of Judah, city by city,

019:006 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not
        for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.

019:007 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed
        and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor
        respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.

019:008 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and
        of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for
        the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they
        returned to Jerusalem.

019:009 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of
        the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.

019:010 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
        dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and
        commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them
        that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come
        upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not
        trespass.

019:011 And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all
        matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the
        ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also
        the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously,
        and the LORD shall be with the good.

020:001 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab,
        and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the
        Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.

020:002 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There
        cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on
        this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which
        is Engedi.

020:003 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and
        proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

020:004 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the
        LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek
        the LORD.

020:005 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and
        Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,

020:006 And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in
        heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the
        heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so
        that none is able to withstand thee?

020:007 Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of
        this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed
        of Abraham thy friend for ever?

020:008 And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary
        therein for thy name, saying,

020:009 If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or
        pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy
        presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee
        in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.

020:010 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount
        Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came
        out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and
        destroyed them not;

020:011 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of
        thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.

020:012 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might
        against this great company that cometh against us; neither
        know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.

020:013 And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones,
        their wives, and their children.

020:014 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah,
        the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons
        of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the
        congregation;

020:015 And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of
        Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto
        you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great
        multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.

020:016 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the
        cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook,
        before the wilderness of Jeruel.

020:017 Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves,
        stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O
        Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go
        out against them: for the LORD will be with you.

020:018 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground:
        and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the
        LORD, worshipping the LORD.

020:019 And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the
        children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of
        Israel with a loud voice on high.

020:020 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the
        wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood
        and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem;
        Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established;
        believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.

020:021 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed
        singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of
        holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise
        the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.

020:022 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set
        ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount
        Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.

020:023 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
        inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them:
        and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir,
        every one helped to destroy another.

020:024 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,
        they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead
        bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.

020:025 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the
        spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches
        with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped
        off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they
        were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.

020:026 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley
        of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the
        name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah,
        unto this day.

020:027 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and
        Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem
        with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their
        enemies.

020:028 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and
        trumpets unto the house of the LORD.

020:029 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those
        countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against
        the enemies of Israel.

020:030 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him
        rest round about.

020:031 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five
        years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and
        five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the
        daughter of Shilhi.

020:032 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not
        from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.

020:033 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the
        people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their
        fathers.

020:034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last,
        behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of
        Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.

020:035 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
        Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:

020:036 And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to
        Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.

020:037 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
        Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with
        Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were
        broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

021:001 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
        his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned
        in his stead.

021:002 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and
        Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and
        Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of
        Israel.

021:003 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,
        and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the
        kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.

021:004 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he
        strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the
        sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.

021:005 Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

021:006 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did
        the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife:
        and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.

021:007 Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because
        of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he
        promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.

021:008 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of
        Judah, and made themselves a king.

021:009 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots
        with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites
        which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.

021:010 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto
        this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his
        hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.

021:011 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and
        caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and
        compelled Judah thereto.

021:012 And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet,
        saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because
        thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father,
        nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

021:013 But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast
        made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring,
        like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast
        slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better
        than thyself:

021:014 Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people,
        and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:

021:015 And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels,
        until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by
        day.

021:016 Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
        Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the
        Ethiopians:

021:017 And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried
        away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and
        his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son
        left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.

021:018 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
        incurable disease.

021:019 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of
        two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so
        he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for
        him, like the burning of his fathers.

021:020 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he
        reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being
        desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not
        in the sepulchres of the kings.

022:001 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son
        king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the
        Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the
        son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.

022:002 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign,
        and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
        was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.

022:003 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his
        mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.

022:004 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house
        of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his
        father to his destruction.

022:005 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the
        son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria
        at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.

022:006 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds
        which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king
        of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went
        down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was
        sick.

022:007 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram:
        for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu
        the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the
        house of Ahab.

022:008 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment
        upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and
        the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to
        Ahaziah, he slew them.

022:009 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in
        Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain
        him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of
        Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the
        house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.

022:010 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
        dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house
        of Judah.

022:011 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
        of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were
        slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So
        Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of
        Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid
        him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.

022:012 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and
        Athaliah reigned over the land.

023:001 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and
        took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and
        Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and
        Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri,
        into covenant with him.

023:002 And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of
        all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of
        Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.

023:003 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
        house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son
        shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.

023:004 This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you
        entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites,
        shall be porters of the doors;

023:005 And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third
        part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall
        be in the courts of the house of the LORD.

023:006 But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the
        priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go
        in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch
        of the LORD.

023:007 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
        with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into
        the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king
        when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.

023:008 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
        Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men
        that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go
        out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the
        courses.

023:009 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
        hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king
        David's, which were in the house of God.

023:010 And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his
        hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of
        the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king
        round about.

023:011 Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the
        crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And
        Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the
        king.

023:012 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
        praising the king, she came to the people into the house of
        the LORD:

023:013 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at
        the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king:
        and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with
        trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and
        such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes,
        and said, Treason, Treason.

023:014 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
        that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her
        forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain
        with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house
        of the LORD.

023:015 So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the
        entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her
        there.

023:016 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
        people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's
        people.

023:017 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it
        down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew
        Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.

023:018 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD
        by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had
        distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt
        offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses,
        with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.

023:019 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,
        that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.

023:020 And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
        governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and
        brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they
        came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the
        king upon the throne of the kingdom.

023:021 And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was
        quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

024:001 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was
        Zibiah of Beersheba.

024:002 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD
        all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

024:003 And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
        daughters.

024:004 And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to
        repair the house of the LORD.

024:005 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said
        to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all
        Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to
        year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites
        hastened it not.

024:006 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,
        Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of
        Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the
        commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the
        congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?

024:007 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the
        house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house
        of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.

024:008 And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it
        without at the gate of the house of the LORD.

024:009 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to
        bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of
        God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.

024:010 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought
        in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.

024:011 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought
        unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when
        they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the
        high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it,
        and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day,
        and gathered money in abundance.

024:012 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of
        the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and
        carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as
        wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.

024:013 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them,
        and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened
        it.

024:014 And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the
        money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels
        for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to
        offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And
        they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD
        continually all the days of Jehoiada.

024:015 But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an
        hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.

024:016 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
        because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and
        toward his house.

024:017 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and
        made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

024:018 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and
        served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and
        Jerusalem for this their trespass.

024:019 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the
        LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give
        ear.

024:020 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
        the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them,
        Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the
        LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the
        LORD, he hath also forsaken you.

024:021 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at
        the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the
        LORD.

024:022 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada
        his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he
        died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.

024:023 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of
        Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and
        Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from
        among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king
        of Damascus.

024:024 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,
        and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand,
        because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So
        they executed judgment against Joash.

024:025 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in
        great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for
        the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on
        his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of
        David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.

024:026 And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son
        of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a
        Moabitess.

024:027 Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid
        upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they
        are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah
        his son reigned in his stead.

025:001 Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

025:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but
        not with a perfect heart.

025:003 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,
        that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.

025:004 But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in
        the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded,
        saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither
        shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall
        die for his own sin.

025:005 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them
        captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according
        to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and
        Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and
        above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able
        to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.

025:006 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
        Israel for an hundred talents of silver.

025:007 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not
        the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with
        Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.

025:008 But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God
        shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to
        help, and to cast down.

025:009 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for
        the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?
        And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee
        much more than this.

025:010 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to
        him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger
        was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in
        great anger.

025:011 And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people,
        and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of
        Seir ten thousand.

025:012 And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah
        carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock,
        and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all
        were broken in pieces.

025:013 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that
        they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of
        Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three
        thousand of them, and took much spoil.

025:014 Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the
        slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the
        children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed
        down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.

025:015 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah,
        and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast
        thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not
        deliver their own people out of thine hand?

025:016 And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said
        unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why
        shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said,
        I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou
        hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.

025:017 Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the
        son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying,
        Come, let us see one another in the face.

025:018 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
        saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
        was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
        and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and
        trode down the thistle.

025:019 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine
        heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why
        shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall,
        even thou, and Judah with thee?

025:020 But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might
        deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they
        sought after the gods of Edom.

025:021 So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another
        in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at
        Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

025:022 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled
        every man to his tent.

025:023 And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the
        son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought
        him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from
        the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

025:024 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels
        that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the
        treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned
        to Samaria.

025:025 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
        death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

025:026 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,
        are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and
        Israel?

025:027 Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following
        the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and
        he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and
        slew him there.

025:028 And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his
        fathers in the city of Judah.

026:001 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen
        years old, and made him king in the room of his father
        Amaziah.

026:002 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
        slept with his fathers.

026:003 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he
        reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
        also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.

026:004 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his father Amaziah did.

026:005 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had
        understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought
        the LORD, God made him to prosper.

026:006 And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and
        brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the
        wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the
        Philistines.

026:007 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the
        Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.

026:008 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread
        abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened
        himself exceedingly.

026:009 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate,
        and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and
        fortified them.

026:010 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for
        he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the
        plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains,
        and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.

026:011 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to
        war by bands, according to the number of their account by the
        hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the
        hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.

026:012 The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men
        of valour were two thousand and six hundred.

026:013 And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and
        seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty
        power, to help the king against the enemy.

026:014 And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,
        and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings
        to cast stones.

026:015 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to
        be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and
        great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he
        was marvellously helped, till he was strong.

026:016 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his
        destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and
        went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the
        altar of incense.

026:017 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him
        fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:

026:018 And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It
        appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the
        LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are
        consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou
        hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the
        LORD God.

026:019 Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn
        incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy
        even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house
        of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.

026:020 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon
        him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they
        thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go
        out, because the LORD had smitten him.

026:021 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and
        dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off
        from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the
        king's house, judging the people of the land.

026:022 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah
        the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.

026:023 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
        fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the
        kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son
        reigned in his stead.

027:001 Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
        also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.

027:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he
        entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did
        yet corruptly.

027:003 He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the
        wall of Ophel he built much.

027:004 Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the
        forests he built castles and towers.

027:005 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
        against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year
        an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of
        wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of
        Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.

027:006 So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before
        the LORD his God.

027:007 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his
        ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel
        and Judah.

027:008 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
        reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

027:009 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
        city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

028:001 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which
        was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:

028:002 For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made
        also molten images for Baalim.

028:003 Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
        and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of
        the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of
        Israel.

028:004 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and
        on the hills, and under every green tree.

028:005 Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the
        king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great
        multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And
        he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who
        smote him with a great slaughter.

028:006 For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and
        twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men;
        because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.

028:007 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's
        son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that
        was next to the king.

028:008 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their
        brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and
        took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to
        Samaria.

028:009 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and
        he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said
        unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was
        wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and
        ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.

028:010 And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and
        Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there
        not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?

028:011 Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which
        ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath
        of the LORD is upon you.

028:012 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah
        the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and
        Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai,
        stood up against them that came from the war,

028:013 And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither:
        for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye
        intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our
        trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.

028:014 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the
        princes and all the congregation.

028:015 And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the
        captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among
        them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat
        and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of
        them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm
        trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.

028:016 At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to
        help him.

028:017 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried
        away captives.

028:018 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low
        country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh,
        and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages
        thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and
        the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.

028:019 For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;
        for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the
        LORD.

028:020 And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and
        distressed him, but strengthened him not.

028:021 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and
        out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it
        unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.

028:022 And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more
        against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.

028:023 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him:
        and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them,
        therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But
        they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.

028:024 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God,
        and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up
        the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in
        every corner of Jerusalem.

028:025 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn
        incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of
        his fathers.

028:026 Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,
        behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and
        Israel.

028:027 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
        city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the
        sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son
        reigned in his stead.

029:001 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old,
        and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.

029:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that David his father had done.

029:003 He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened
        the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.

029:004 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered
        them together into the east street,

029:005 And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now
        yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your
        fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.

029:006 For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil
        in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and
        have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD,
        and turned their backs.

029:007 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the
        lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings
        in the holy place unto the God of Israel.

029:008 Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem,
        and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to
        hissing, as ye see with your eyes.

029:009 For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons
        and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.

029:010 Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God
        of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.

029:011 My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to
        stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister
        unto him, and burn incense.

029:012 Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the
        son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons
        of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of
        Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and
        Eden the son of Joah:

029:013 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the
        sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:

029:014 And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons
        of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.

029:015 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves,
        and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the
        words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.

029:016 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
        LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that
        they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the
        house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out
        abroad into the brook Kidron.

029:017 Now they began on the first day of the first month to
        sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the
        porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in
        eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they
        made an end.

029:018 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have
        cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt
        offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread
        table, with all the vessels thereof.

029:019 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did
        cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and
        sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the
        LORD.

029:020 Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of
        the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.

029:021 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
        lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom,
        and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the
        priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the
        LORD.

029:022 So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the
        blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had
        killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they
        killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the
        altar.

029:023 And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering
        before the king and the congregation; and they laid their
        hands upon them:

029:024 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with
        their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all
        Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the
        sin offering should be made for all Israel.

029:025 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,
        with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment
        of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet:
        for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.

029:026 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the
        priests with the trumpets.

029:027 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
        altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD
        began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments
        ordained by David king of Israel.

029:028 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and
        the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt
        offering was finished.

029:029 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all
        that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.

029:030 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the
        Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David,
        and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness,
        and they bowed their heads and worshipped.

029:031 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated
        yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and
        thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the
        congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as
        many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.

029:032 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
        brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and
        two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the
        LORD.

029:033 And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
        thousand sheep.

029:034 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all
        the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did
        help them, till the work was ended, and until the other
        priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more
        upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.

029:035 And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat
        of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every
        burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was
        set in order.

029:036 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had
        prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.

030:001 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters
        also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the
        house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the
        LORD God of Israel.

030:002 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
        congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second
        month.

030:003 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests
        had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the
        people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.

030:004 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.

030:005 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout
        all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come
        to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem:
        for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was
        written.

030:006 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his
        princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the
        commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn
        again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he
        will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the
        hand of the kings of Assyria.

030:007 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
        trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who
        therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.

030:008 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield
        yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which
        he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that
        the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.

030:009 For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your
        children shall find compassion before them that lead them
        captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the
        LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away
        his face from you, if ye return unto him.

030:010 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
        Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them
        to scorn, and mocked them.

030:011 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun
        humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.

030:012 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do
        the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of
        the LORD.

030:013 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
        of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great
        congregation.

030:014 And they arose and took away the altars that were in
        Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and
        cast them into the brook Kidron.

030:015 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
        second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed,
        and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings
        into the house of the LORD.

030:016 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to
        the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the
        blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.

030:017 For there were many in the congregation that were not
        sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the
        killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to
        sanctify them unto the LORD.

030:018 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and
        Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves,
        yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written.
        But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon
        every one

030:019 That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his
        fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the
        purification of the sanctuary.

030:020 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.

030:021 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
        the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness:
        and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day,
        singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.

030:022 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that
        taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat
        throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and
        making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.

030:023 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:
        and they kept other seven days with gladness.

030:024 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
        thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes
        gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand
        sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.

030:025 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
        Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and
        the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that
        dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.

030:026 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of
        Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like
        in Jerusalem.

030:027 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and
        their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy
        dwelling place, even unto heaven.

031:001 Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present
        went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in
        pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high
        places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in
        Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed
        them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man
        to his possession, into their own cities.

031:002 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the
        Levites after their courses, every man according to his
        service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for
        peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to
        praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.

031:003 He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the
        burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt
        offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for
        the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the
        law of the LORD.

031:004 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to
        give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they
        might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.

031:005 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of
        Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and
        oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the
        tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.

031:006 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in
        the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen
        and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated
        unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.

031:007 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the
        heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.

031:008 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
        blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.

031:009 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites
        concerning the heaps.

031:010 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered
        him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings
        into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and
        have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and
        that which is left is this great store.

031:011 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of
        the LORD; and they prepared them,

031:012 And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated
        things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler,
        and Shimei his brother was the next.

031:013 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
        and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and
        Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei
        his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and
        Azariah the ruler of the house of God.

031:014 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the
        east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute
        the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.

031:015 And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and
        Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the
        priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by
        courses, as well to the great as to the small:

031:016 Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and
        upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of
        the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges
        according to their courses;

031:017 Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their
        fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in
        their charges by their courses;

031:018 And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives,
        and their sons, and their daughters, through all the
        congregation: for in their set office they sanctified
        themselves in holiness:

031:019 Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the
        fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city,
        the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all
        the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by
        genealogies among the Levites.

031:020 And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that
        which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.

031:021 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
        God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God,
        he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

032:001 After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib
        king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped
        against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for
        himself.

032:002 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he
        was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,

032:003 He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop
        the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and
        they did help him.

032:004 So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all
        the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the
        land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find
        much water?

032:005 Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that
        was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall
        without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made
        darts and shields in abundance.

032:006 And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
        together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and
        spake comfortably to them, saying,

032:007 Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the
        king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him:
        for there be more with us than with him:

032:008 With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God
        to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested
        themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

032:009 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants
        to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and
        all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto
        all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,

032:010 Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust,
        that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?

032:011 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die
        by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall
        deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

032:012 Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his
        altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall
        worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?

032:013 Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the
        people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those
        lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?

032:014 Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my
        fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out
        of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out
        of mine hand?

032:015 Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you
        on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any
        nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine
        hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall
        your God deliver you out of mine hand?

032:016 And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and
        against his servant Hezekiah.

032:017 He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and
        to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of
        other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand,
        so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of
        mine hand.

032:018 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the
        people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them,
        and to trouble them; that they might take the city.

032:019 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the
        gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the
        hands of man.

032:020 And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah
        the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.

032:021 And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men
        of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the
        king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own
        land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they
        that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the
        sword.

032:022 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
        from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the
        hand of all other, and guided them on every side.

032:023 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and
        presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified
        in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.

032:024 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto
        the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.

032:025 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
        unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was
        wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.

032:026 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
        heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the
        wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

032:027 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
        himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious
        stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of
        pleasant jewels;

032:028 Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil;
        and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.

032:029 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and
        herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.

032:030 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of
        Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the
        city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.

032:031 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
        Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was
        done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know
        all that was in his heart.

032:032 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness,
        behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet,
        the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and
        Israel.

032:033 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
        the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all
        Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his
        death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

033:001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:

033:002 But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like
        unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast
        out before the children of Israel.

033:003 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father
        had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made
        groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served
        them.

033:004 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the
        LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.

033:005 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two
        courts of the house of the LORD.

033:006 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the
        valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used
        enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar
        spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of
        the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

033:007 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the
        house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon
        his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen
        before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

033:008 Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of
        the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they
        will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according
        to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the
        hand of Moses.

033:009 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to
        err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had
        destroyed before the children of Israel.

033:010 And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they
        would not hearken.

033:011 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host
        of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns,
        and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.

033:012 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God,
        and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,

033:013 And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard
        his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his
        kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.

033:014 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on
        the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in
        at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up
        a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced
        cities of Judah.

033:015 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the
        house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the
        mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast
        them out of the city.

033:016 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon
        peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to
        serve the LORD God of Israel.

033:017 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high
        places, yet unto the LORD their God only.

033:018 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
        God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name
        of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the
        book of the kings of Israel.

033:019 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his
        sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high
        places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was
        humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the
        seers.

033:020 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
        own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

033:021 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
        reigned two years in Jerusalem.

033:022 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
        did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the
        carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served
        them;

033:023 And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his
        father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.

033:024 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his
        own house.

033:025 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
        against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his
        son king in his stead.

034:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.

034:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
        walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither
        to the right hand, nor to the left.

034:003 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,
        he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the
        twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the
        high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the
        molten images.

034:004 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and
        the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the
        groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake
        in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the
        graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.

034:005 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and
        cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.

034:006 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and
        Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.

034:007 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had
        beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the
        idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to
        Jerusalem.

034:008 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged
        the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah,
        and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of
        Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.

034:009 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered
        the money that was brought into the house of God, which the
        Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of
        Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of
        all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.

034:010 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
        oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the
        workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and
        amend the house:

034:011 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn
        stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which
        the kings of Judah had destroyed.

034:012 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them
        were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari;
        and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to
        set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill
        of instruments of musick.

034:013 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers
        of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of
        the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.

034:014 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the
        house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law
        of the LORD given by Moses.

034:015 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have
        found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
        Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.

034:016 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king
        word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy
        servants, they do it.

034:017 And they have gathered together the money that was found in
        the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of
        the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.

034:018 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the
        priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the
        king.

034:019 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
        law, that he rent his clothes.

034:020 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
        and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah
        a servant of the king's, saying,

034:021 Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in
        Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is
        found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out
        upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the
        LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.

034:022 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to
        Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath,
        the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in
        Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that
        effect.

034:023 And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
        ye the man that sent you to me,

034:024 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
        place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses
        that are written in the book which they have read before the
        king of Judah:

034:025 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
        other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
        works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out
        upon this place, and shall not be quenched.

034:026 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the
        LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
        Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;

034:027 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself
        before God, when thou heardest his words against this place,
        and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself
        before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I
        have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.

034:028 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
        gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see
        all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the
        inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.

034:029 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of
        Judah and Jerusalem.

034:030 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
        men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the
        priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small:
        and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the
        covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.

034:031 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before
        the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his
        commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all
        his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the
        covenant which are written in this book.

034:032 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin
        to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according
        to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.

034:033 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
        countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made
        all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the
        LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from
        following the LORD, the God of their fathers.

035:001 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem:
        and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
        first month.

035:002 And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them
        to the service of the house of the LORD,

035:003 And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were
        holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which
        Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall
        not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your
        God, and his people Israel,

035:004 And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after
        your courses, according to the writing of David king of
        Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.

035:005 And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
        families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after
        the division of the families of the Levites.

035:006 So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare
        your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the
        LORD by the hand of Moses.

035:007 And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids,
        all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to
        the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks:
        these were of the king's substance.

035:008 And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the
        priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel,
        rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the
        passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle
        and three hundred oxen.

035:009 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
        Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave
        unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small
        cattle, and five hundred oxen.

035:010 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their
        place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the
        king's commandment.

035:011 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the
        blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.

035:012 And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give
        according to the divisions of the families of the people, to
        offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses.
        And so did they with the oxen.

035:013 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the
        ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and
        in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all
        the people.

035:014 And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the
        priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in
        offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore
        the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the
        sons of Aaron.

035:015 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place,
        according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman,
        and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every
        gate; they might not depart from their service; for their
        brethren the Levites prepared for them.

035:016 So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to
        keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar
        of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.

035:017 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover
        at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.

035:018 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the
        days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of
        Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests,
        and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present,
        and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

035:019 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this
        passover kept.

035:020 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho
        king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by
        Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.

035:021 But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with
        thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day,
        but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded
        me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is
        with me, that he destroy thee not.

035:022 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but
        disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened
        not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to
        fight in the valley of Megiddo.

035:023 And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his
        servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.

035:024 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put
        him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to
        Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the
        sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned
        for Josiah.

035:025 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and
        the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to
        this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold,
        they are written in the lamentations.

035:026 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness,
        according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,

035:027 And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the
        book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

036:001 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,
        and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.

036:002 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to
        reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.

036:003 And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned
        the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.

036:004 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah
        and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho
        took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.

036:005 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to
        reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did
        that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.

036:006 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound
        him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.

036:007 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the
        LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.

036:008 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations
        which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they
        are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and
        Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

036:009 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did
        that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.

036:010 And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and
        brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house
        of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and
        Jerusalem.

036:011 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,
        and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

036:012 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his
        God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet
        speaking from the mouth of the LORD.

036:013 And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made
        him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his
        heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.

036:014 Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,
        transgressed very much after all the abominations of the
        heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had
        hallowed in Jerusalem.

036:015 And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his
        messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had
        compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:

036:016 But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words,
        and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose
        against his people, till there was no remedy.

036:017 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who
        slew their young men with the sword in the house of their
        sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old
        man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his
        hand.

036:018 And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and
        the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of
        the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.

036:019 And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of
        Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and
        destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.

036:020 And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to
        Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until
        the reign of the kingdom of Persia:

036:021 To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until
        the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay
        desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.

036:022 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
        of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be
        accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of
        Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his
        kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,

036:023 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth
        hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me
        to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is
        there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with
        him, and let him go up.

Book 15	Ezra

001:001 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
        of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the
        LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he
        made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it
        also in writing, saying,

001:002 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath
        given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me
        to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

001:003 Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him,
        and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build
        the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is
        in Jerusalem.

001:004 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let
        the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and
        with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for
        the house of God that is in Jerusalem.

001:005 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin,
        and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit
        God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which
        is in Jerusalem.

001:006 And all they that were about them strengthened their hands
        with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with
        beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was
        willingly offered.

001:007 Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of
        the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of
        Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;

001:008 Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of
        Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar,
        the prince of Judah.

001:009 And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a
        thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,

001:010 Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four
        hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.

001:011 All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and
        four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of
        the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto
        Jerusalem.

002:001 Now these are the children of the province that went up out of
        the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom
        Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto
        Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one
        unto his city;

002:002 Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah,
        Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah.
        The number of the men of the people of Israel:

        nine hundred seventy and three.

        children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of
        Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, in all
        an hundred thirty and nine.

002:043 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha,
        the children of Tabbaoth,

002:044 The children of Keros, the children of Siaha, the children of
        Padon,

002:045 The children of Lebanah, the children of Hagabah, the children
        of Akkub,

002:046 The children of Hagab, the children of Shalmai, the children
        of Hanan,

002:047 The children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, the children of
        Reaiah,

002:048 The children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, the children of
        Gazzam,

002:049 The children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of
        Besai,

002:050 The children of Asnah, the children of Mehunim, the children
        of Nephusim,

002:051 The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children
        of Harhur,

002:052 The children of Bazluth, the children of Mehida, the children
        of Harsha,

002:053 The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children
        of Thamah,

002:054 The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.

002:055 The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the
        children of Sophereth, the children of Peruda,

002:056 The children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children
        of Giddel,

002:057 The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the
        children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami.

002:058 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants,
        were three hundred ninety and two.

002:059 And these were they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa,
        Cherub, Addan, and Immer: but they could not shew their
        father's house, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:

002:060 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children
        of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.

002:061 And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah,
        the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a
        wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was
        called after their name:

002:062 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
        genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as
        polluted, put from the priesthood.

002:063 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of
        the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim
        and with Thummim.

002:064 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
        three hundred and threescore,

002:065 Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were
        seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were
        among them two hundred singing men and singing women.

002:066 Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules,
        two hundred forty and five;

002:067 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six
        thousand seven hundred and twenty.

002:068 And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the
        house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for
        the house of God to set it up in his place:

002:069 They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work
        threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand
        pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.

002:070 So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and
        the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in
        their cities, and all Israel in their cities.

003:001 And when the seventh month was come, and the children of
        Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves
        together as one man to Jerusalem.

003:002 Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the
        priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his
        brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer
        burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses
        the man of God.

003:003 And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them
        because of the people of those countries: and they offered
        burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings
        morning and evening.

003:004 They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and
        offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the
        custom, as the duty of every day required;

003:005 And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of
        the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were
        consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a
        freewill offering unto the LORD.

003:006 From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer
        burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the
        temple of the LORD was not yet laid.

003:007 They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters;
        and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them
        of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of
        Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of
        Persia.

003:008 Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God
        at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of
        Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of
        their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that
        were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed
        the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward
        the work of the house of the LORD.

003:009 Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and
        his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the
        workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their
        sons and their brethren the Levites.

003:010 And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the
        LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and
        the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the
        LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.

003:011 And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks
        unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for
        ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great
        shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of
        the house of the LORD was laid.

003:012 But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers,
        who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the
        foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with
        a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:

003:013 So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of
        joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the
        people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar
        off.

004:001 Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
        children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God
        of Israel;

004:002 Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers,
        and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your
        God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of
        Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.

004:003 But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the
        fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with
        us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together
        will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king
        of Persia hath commanded us.

004:004 Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people
        of Judah, and troubled them in building,

004:005 And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their
        purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the
        reign of Darius king of Persia.

004:006 And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign,
        wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of
        Judah and Jerusalem.

004:007 And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath,
        Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king
        of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the
        Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.

004:008 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter
        against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:

004:009 Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and
        the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the
        Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the
        Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites,
        and the Elamites,

004:010 And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper
        brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest
        that are on this side the river, and at such a time.

004:011 This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even
        unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side
        the river, and at such a time.

004:012 Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from
        thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious
        and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and
        joined the foundations.

004:013 Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded,
        and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll,
        tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of
        the kings.

004:014 Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it
        was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore
        have we sent and certified the king;

004:015 That search may be made in the book of the records of thy
        fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and
        know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto
        kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within
        the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.

004:016 We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and
        the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no
        portion on this side the river.

004:017 Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to
        Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that
        dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace,
        and at such a time.

004:018 The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before
        me.

004:019 And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found
        that this city of old time hath made insurrection against
        kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.

004:020 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have
        ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute,
        and custom, was paid unto them.

004:021 Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that
        this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be
        given from me.

004:022 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage
        grow to the hurt of the kings?

004:023 Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before
        Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they
        went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to
        cease by force and power.

004:024 Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at
        Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of
        Darius king of Persia.

005:001 Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son
        of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and
        Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.

005:002 Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the
        son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is
        at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping
        them.

005:003 At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side
        the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said
        thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house,
        and to make up this wall?

005:004 Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names
        of the men that make this building?

005:005 But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that
        they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to
        Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning
        this matter.

005:006 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the
        river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites,
        which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:

005:007 They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto
        Darius the king, all peace.

005:008 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of
        Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with
        great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work
        goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.

005:009 Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who
        commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?

005:010 We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might
        write the names of the men that were the chief of them.

005:011 And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants
        of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was
        builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel
        builded and set up.

005:012 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto
        wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king
        of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and
        carried the people away into Babylon.

005:013 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same
        king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.

005:014 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,
        which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in
        Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those
        did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they
        were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he
        had made governor;

005:015 And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the
        temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be
        builded in his place.

005:016 Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the
        house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even
        until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not
        finished.

005:017 Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be
        search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at
        Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the
        king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king
        send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

006:001 Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the
        house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in
        Babylon.

006:002 And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the
        province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus
        written:

006:003 In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king
        made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let
        the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices,
        and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height
        thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore
        cubits;

006:004 With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and
        let the expenses be given out of the king's house:

006:005 And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of
        God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which
        is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and
        brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one
        to his place, and place them in the house of God.

006:006 Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river,
        Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which
        are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:

006:007 Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of
        the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in
        his place.

006:008 Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of
        these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the
        king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith
        expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.

006:009 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and
        rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven,
        wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of
        the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day
        by day without fail:

006:010 That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God
        of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.

006:011 Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this
        word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set
        up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a
        dunghill for this.

006:012 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy
        all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter
        and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I
        Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.

006:013 Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai,
        and their companions, according to that which Darius the king
        had sent, so they did speedily.

006:014 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through
        the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of
        Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the
        commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the
        commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of
        Persia.

006:015 And this house was finished on the third day of the month
        Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the
        king.

006:016 And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and
        the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication
        of this house of God with joy.

006:017 And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred
        bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin
        offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the
        number of the tribes of Israel.

006:018 And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites
        in their courses, for the service of God, which is at
        Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.

006:019 And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
        fourteenth day of the first month.

006:020 For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of
        them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children
        of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for
        themselves.

006:021 And the children of Israel, which were come again out of
        captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them
        from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the
        LORD God of Israel, did eat,

006:022 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy:
        for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the
        king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the
        work of the house of God, the God of Israel.

007:001 Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of
        Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son
        of Hilkiah,

007:002 The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,

007:003 The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,

007:004 The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,

007:005 The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
        the son of Aaron the chief priest:

007:006 This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in
        the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and
        the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of
        the LORD his God upon him.

007:007 And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the
        priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters,
        and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of
        Artaxerxes the king.

007:008 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the
        seventh year of the king.

007:009 For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up
        from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he
        to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.

007:010 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD,
        and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

007:011 Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes
        gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the
        words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to
        Israel.

007:012 Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of
        the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a
        time.

007:013 I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of
        his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of
        their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.

007:014 Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven
        counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem,
        according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand;

007:015 And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his
        counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose
        habitation is in Jerusalem,

007:016 And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the
        province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people,
        and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their
        God which is in Jerusalem:

007:017 That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams,
        lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings,
        and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which
        is in Jerusalem.

007:018 And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren,
        to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after
        the will of your God.

007:019 The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the
        house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of
        Jerusalem.

007:020 And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God,
        which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the
        king's treasure house.

007:021 And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the
        treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra
        the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall
        require of you, it be done speedily,

007:022 Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures
        of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred
        baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.

007:023 Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be
        diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why
        should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his
        sons?

007:024 Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and
        Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this
        house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute,
        or custom, upon them.

007:025 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine
        hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the
        people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of
        thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.

007:026 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of
        the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether
        it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of
        goods, or to imprisonment.

007:027 Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a
        thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of
        the LORD which is in Jerusalem:

007:028 And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his
        counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I
        was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me,
        and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with
        me.

008:001 These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the
        genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the
        reign of Artaxerxes the king.

008:002 Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar;
        Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.

008:003 Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah:
        and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an
        hundred and fifty.

008:004 Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and
        with him two hundred males.

008:005 Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him
        three hundred males.

008:006 Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with
        him fifty males.

008:007 And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and
        with him seventy males.

008:008 And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael,
        and with him fourscore males.

008:009 Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him
        two hundred and eighteen males.

008:010 And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with
        him an hundred and threescore males.

008:011 And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with
        him twenty and eight males.

008:012 And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and
        with him an hundred and ten males.

008:013 And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these,
        Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore
        males.

008:014 Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them
        seventy males.

008:015 And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to
        Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed
        the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons
        of Levi.

008:016 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for
        Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and
        for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib,
        and for Elnathan, men of understanding.

008:017 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the
        place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto
        Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place
        Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the
        house of our God.

008:018 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man
        of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the
        son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren,
        eighteen;

008:019 And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari,
        his brethren and their sons, twenty;

008:020 Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had
        appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and
        twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.

008:021 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we
        might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right
        way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our
        substance.

008:022 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers
        and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because
        we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is
        upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his
        wrath is against all them that forsake him.

008:023 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was
        intreated of us.

008:024 Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests,
        Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,

008:025 And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the
        vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the
        king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there
        present, had offered:

008:026 I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents
        of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold
        an hundred talents;

008:027 Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two
        vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.

008:028 And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels
        are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill
        offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.

008:029 Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief
        of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of
        Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the
        LORD.

008:030 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver,
        and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto
        the house of our God.

008:031 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of
        the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God
        was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy,
        and of such as lay in wait by the way.

008:032 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.

008:033 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the
        vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of
        Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar
        the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of
        Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;

008:034 By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was
        written at that time.

008:035 Also the children of those that had been carried away, which
        were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto
        the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and
        six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin
        offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.

008:036 And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's
        lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and
        they furthered the people, and the house of God.

009:001 Now when these things were done, the princes came to me,
        saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the
        Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the
        lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the
        Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the
        Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.

009:002 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for
        their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with
        the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and
        rulers hath been chief in this trespass.

009:003 And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle,
        and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat
        down astonied.

009:004 Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the
        words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of
        those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the
        evening sacrifice.

009:005 And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and
        having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees,
        and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,

009:006 And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face
        to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our
        head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.

009:007 Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass
        unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and
        our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the
        lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to
        confusion of face, as it is this day.

009:008 And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the
        LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us
        a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes,
        and give us a little reviving in our bondage.

009:009 For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our
        bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the
        kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of
        our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us
        a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.

009:010 And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have
        forsaken thy commandments,

009:011 Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets,
        saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an
        unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands,
        with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to
        another with their uncleanness.

009:012 Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither
        take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or
        their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good
        of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children
        for ever.

009:013 And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for
        our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us
        less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such
        deliverance as this;

009:014 Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity
        with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be
        angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there
        should be no remnant nor escaping?

009:015 O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet
        escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our
        trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.

010:001 Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping
        and casting himself down before the house of God, there
        assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of
        men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.

010:002 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam,
        answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our
        God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land:
        yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.

010:003 Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away
        all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the
        counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the
        commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the
        law.

010:004 Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be
        with thee: be of good courage, and do it.

010:005 Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and
        all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this
        word. And they sware.

010:006 Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into
        the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came
        thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned
        because of the transgression of them that had been carried
        away.

010:007 And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto
        all the children of the captivity, that they should gather
        themselves together unto Jerusalem;

010:008 And that whosoever would not come within three days, according
        to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his
        substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the
        congregation of those that had been carried away.

010:009 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves
        together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth
        month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people
        sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of
        this matter, and for the great rain.

010:010 And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
        transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the
        trespass of Israel.

010:011 Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your
        fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the
        people of the land, and from the strange wives.

010:012 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,
        As thou hast said, so must we do.

010:013 But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we
        are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one
        day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this
        thing.

010:014 Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all
        them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at
        appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and
        the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this
        matter be turned from us.

010:015 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah
        were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai
        the Levite helped them.

010:016 And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest,
        with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their
        fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and
        sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the
        matter.

010:017 And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange
        wives by the first day of the first month.

010:018 And among the sons of the priests there were found that had
        taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of
        Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib,
        and Gedaliah.

010:019 And they gave their hands that they would put away their
        wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for
        their trespass.

010:020 And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.

010:021 And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah,
        and Jehiel, and Uzziah.

010:022 And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael,
        Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.

010:023 Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the
        same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.

010:024 Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum,
        and Telem, and Uri.

010:025 Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah,
        and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and
        Benaiah.

010:026 And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and
        Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.

010:027 And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and
        Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.

010:028 Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and
        Athlai.

010:029 And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah,
        Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.

010:030 And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah,
        Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.

010:031 And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah,
        Shemaiah, Shimeon,

010:032 Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.

010:033 Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet,
        Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.

010:034 Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,

010:035 Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,

010:036 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,

010:037 Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,

010:038 And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,

010:039 And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,

010:040 Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,

010:041 Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,

010:042 Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.

010:043 Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau,
        and Joel, Benaiah.

010:044 All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives
        by whom they had children.

Book 16	Nehemiah

001:001 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to
        pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in
        Shushan the palace,

001:002 That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of
        Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped,
        which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.

001:003 And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the
        captivity there in the province are in great affliction and
        reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the
        gates thereof are burned with fire.

001:004 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down
        and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed
        before the God of heaven,

001:005 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and
        terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that
        love him and observe his commandments:

001:006 Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou
        mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before
        thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy
        servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel,
        which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's
        house have sinned.

001:007 We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept
        the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which
        thou commandedst thy servant Moses.

001:008 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy
        servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you
        abroad among the nations:

001:009 But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them;
        though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of
        the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring
        them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.

001:010 Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast
        redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.

001:011 O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the
        prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who
        desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant
        this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I
        was the king's cupbearer.

002:001 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year
        of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took
        up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been
        beforetime sad in his presence.

002:002 Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad,
        seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of
        heart. Then I was very sore afraid,

002:003 And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should
        not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my
        fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are
        consumed with fire?

002:004 Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request?
        So I prayed to the God of heaven.

002:005 And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy
        servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest
        send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres,
        that I may build it.

002:006 And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,)
        For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return?
        So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.

002:007 Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let
        letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that
        they may convey me over till I come into Judah;

002:008 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that
        he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the
        palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the
        city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king
        granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.

002:009 Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them
        the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army
        and horsemen with me.

002:010 When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
        Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there
        was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.

002:011 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.

002:012 And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither
        told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at
        Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast
        that I rode upon.

002:013 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before
        the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of
        Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were
        consumed with fire.

002:014 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's
        pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me
        to pass.

002:015 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,
        and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so
        returned.

002:016 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither
        had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to
        the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the
        work.

002:017 Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how
        Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with
        fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we
        be no more a reproach.

002:018 Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me;
        as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they
        said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their
        hands for this good work.

002:019 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
        Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to
        scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye
        do? will ye rebel against the king?

002:020 Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven,
        he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and
        build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in
        Jerusalem.

003:001 Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the
        priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it,
        and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they
        sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.

003:002 And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them
        builded Zaccur the son of Imri.

003:003 But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also
        laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the
        locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

003:004 And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the
        son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of
        Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired
        Zadok the son of Baana.

003:005 And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put
        not their necks to the work of their LORD.

003:006 Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and
        Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof,
        and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the
        bars thereof.

003:007 And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon
        the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the
        throne of the governor on this side the river.

003:008 Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the
        goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of
        one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the
        broad wall.

003:009 And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler
        of the half part of Jerusalem.

003:010 And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even
        over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the
        son of Hashabniah.

003:011 Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab,
        repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.

003:012 And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the
        ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.

003:013 The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah;
        they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks
        thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the
        wall unto the dung gate.

003:014 But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the
        ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the
        doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

003:015 But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of
        Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and
        covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof,
        and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by
        the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the
        city of David.

003:016 After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the
        half part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the
        sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto
        the house of the mighty.

003:017 After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next
        unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of
        Keilah, in his part.

003:018 After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad,
        the ruler of the half part of Keilah.

003:019 And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of
        Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury
        at the turning of the wall.

003:020 After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the
        other piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the
        house of Eliashib the high priest.

003:021 After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz
        another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to
        the end of the house of Eliashib.

003:022 And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.

003:023 After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their
        house. After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son
        of Ananiah by his house.

003:024 After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece,
        from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even
        unto the corner.

003:025 Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall,
        and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that
        was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of
        Parosh.

003:026 Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over
        against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that
        lieth out.

003:027 After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against
        the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.

003:028 From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over
        against his house.

003:029 After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his
        house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah,
        the keeper of the east gate.

003:030 After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun
        the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired
        Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber.

003:031 After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place
        of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate
        Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner.

003:032 And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate
        repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.

004:001 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded
        the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked
        the Jews.

004:002 And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and
        said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves?
        will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they
        revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are
        burned?

004:003 Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that
        which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down
        their stone wall.

004:004 Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach
        upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of
        captivity:

004:005 And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted
        out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger
        before the builders.

004:006 So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together
        unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.

004:007 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the
        Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that
        the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches
        began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,

004:008 And conspired all of them together to come and to fight
        against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.

004:009 Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
        against them day and night, because of them.

004:010 And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
        decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to
        build the wall.

004:011 And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see,
        till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause
        the work to cease.

004:012 And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them
        came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye
        shall return unto us they will be upon you.

004:013 Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on
        the higher places, I even set the people after their families
        with their swords, their spears, and their bows.

004:014 And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to
        the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of
        them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and
        fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your
        wives, and your houses.

004:015 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known
        unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we
        returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.

004:016 And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my
        servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held
        both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the
        habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.

004:017 They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens,
        with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought
        in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.

004:018 For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side,
        and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.

004:019 And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest
        of the people, The work is great and large, and we are
        separated upon the wall, one far from another.

004:020 In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
        resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.

004:021 So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears
        from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.

004:022 Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every
        one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night
        they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.

004:023 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of
        the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes,
        saving that every one put them off for washing.

005:001 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives
        against their brethren the Jews.

005:002 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are
        many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and
        live.

005:003 Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
        vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the
        dearth.

005:004 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the
        king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.

005:005 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our
        children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our
        sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our
        daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in
        our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and
        vineyards.

005:006 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.

005:007 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and
        the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of
        his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.

005:008 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
        brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will
        ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us?
        Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.

005:009 Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk
        in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen
        our enemies?

005:010 I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of
        them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.

005:011 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands,
        their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the
        hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and
        the oil, that ye exact of them.

005:012 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing
        of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the
        priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do
        according to this promise.

005:013 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from
        his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this
        promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the
        congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people
        did according to this promise.

005:014 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their
        governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even
        unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that
        is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread
        of the governor.

005:015 But the former governors that had been before me were
        chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and
        wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants
        bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the
        fear of God.

005:016 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought
        we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto
        the work.

005:017 Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the
        Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the
        heathen that are about us.

005:018 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
        choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten
        days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not
        I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy
        upon this people.

005:019 Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have
        done for this people.

006:001 Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the
        Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded
        the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though
        at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)

006:002 That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us
        meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono.
        But they thought to do me mischief.

006:003 And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great
        work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease,
        whilst I leave it, and come down to you?

006:004 Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I
        answered them after the same manner.

006:005 Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the
        fifth time with an open letter in his hand;

006:006 Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and
        Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for
        which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their
        king, according to these words.

006:007 And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
        Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it
        be reported to the king according to these words. Come now
        therefore, and let us take counsel together.

006:008 Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as
        thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.

006:009 For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be
        weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O
        God, strengthen my hands.

006:010 Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah
        the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us
        meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let
        us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay
        thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.

006:011 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there,
        that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his
        life? I will not go in.

006:012 And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
        pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat
        had hired him.

006:013 Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so,
        and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report,
        that they might reproach me.

006:014 My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to
        these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest
        of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.

006:015 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the
        month Elul, in fifty and two days.

006:016 And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof,
        and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they
        were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that
        this work was wrought of our God.

006:017 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters
        unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.

006:018 For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was
        the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son
        Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of
        Berechiah.

006:019 Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my
        words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

007:001 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up
        the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites
        were appointed,

007:002 That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the
        palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and
        feared God above many.

007:003 And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened
        until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut
        the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the
        inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every
        one to be over against his house.

007:004 Now the city was large and great: but the people were few
        therein, and the houses were not builded.

007:005 And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles,
        and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by
        genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them
        which came up at the first, and found written therein,

007:006 These are the children of the province, that went up out of
        the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom
        Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came
        again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;

007:007 Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah,
        Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.
        The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was
        this;

007:008 The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and
        two.

007:009 The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.

007:010 The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two.

007:028 The men of Bethazmaveth, forty and two.

007:029 The men of Kirjathjearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven
        hundred forty and three.

007:030 The men of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred twenty and one.

007:031 The men of Michmas, an hundred and twenty and two.

007:032 The men of Bethel and Ai, an hundred twenty and three.

007:033 The men of the other Nebo, fifty and two.

007:034 The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty
        and four.

007:035 The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty.

007:036 The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.

007:037 The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and
        one.

007:038 The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and
        thirty.

        nine hundred seventy and three.

007:040 The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.

007:041 The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and
        seven.

007:042 The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.

007:043 The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the
        children of Hodevah, seventy and four.

007:045 The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater,
        the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of
        Hatita, the children of Shobai, an hundred thirty and eight.

007:046 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha,
        the children of Tabbaoth,

007:047 The children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of
        Padon,

007:048 The children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children
        of Shalmai,

007:049 The children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of
        Gahar,

007:050 The children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of
        Nekoda,

007:051 The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of
        Phaseah,

007:052 The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of
        Nephishesim,

007:053 The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children
        of Harhur,

007:054 The children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children
        of Harsha,

007:055 The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children
        of Tamah,

007:056 The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.

007:057 The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the
        children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,

007:058 The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of
        Giddel,

007:059 The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the
        children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.

007:060 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants,
        were three hundred ninety and two.

007:061 And these were they which went up also from Telmelah,
        Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew
        their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of
        Israel.

007:062 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children
        of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.

007:063 And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of
        Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took one of the
        daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called
        after their name.

007:064 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
        genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as
        polluted, put from the priesthood.

007:065 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of
        the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim
        and Thummim.

007:066 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
        three hundred and threescore,

007:067 Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there
        were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they
        had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.

007:068 Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two
        hundred forty and five:

007:069 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven
        hundred and twenty asses.

007:070 And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The
        Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty
        basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.

007:071 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of
        the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and
        two hundred pound of silver.

007:072 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand
        drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and
        threescore and seven priests' garments.

007:073 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the
        singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all
        Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month
        came, the children of Israel were in their cities.

008:001 And all the people gathered themselves together as one man
        into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake
        unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses,
        which the LORD had commanded to Israel.

008:002 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation
        both of men and women, and all that could hear with
        understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.

008:003 And he read therein before the street that was before the
        water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and
        the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of
        all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.

008:004 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they
        had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and
        Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on
        his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael,
        and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and
        Meshullam.

008:005 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for
        he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the
        people stood up:

008:006 And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people
        answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they
        bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to
        the ground.

008:007 Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub,
        Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad,
        Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to
        understand the law: and the people stood in their place.

008:008 So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and
        gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.

008:009 And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the
        scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all
        the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn
        not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the
        words of the law.

008:010 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink
        the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is
        prepared: for this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye
        sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.

008:011 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your
        peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.

008:012 And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to
        send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had
        understood the words that were declared unto them.

008:013 And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the
        fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto
        Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.

008:014 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded
        by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths
        in the feast of the seventh month:

008:015 And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities,
        and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch
        olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and
        palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as
        it is written.

008:016 So the people went forth, and brought them, and made
        themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and
        in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in
        the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of
        Ephraim.

008:017 And all the congregation of them that were come again out of
        the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since
        the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the
        children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.

008:018 Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read
        in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven
        days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according
        unto the manner.

009:001 Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of
        Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and
        earth upon them.

009:002 And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all
        strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the
        iniquities of their fathers.

009:003 And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the
        law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and
        another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD
        their God.

009:004 Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and
        Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani,
        and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God.

009:005 Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah,
        Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up
        and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be
        thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and
        praise.

009:006 Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the
        heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all
        things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein,
        and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven
        worshippeth thee.

009:007 Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and
        broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him
        the name of Abraham;

009:008 And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a
        covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the
        Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites,
        and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast
        performed thy words; for thou art righteous:

009:009 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and
        heardest their cry by the Red sea;

009:010 And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his
        servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest
        that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a
        name, as it is this day.

009:011 And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went
        through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their
        persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the
        mighty waters.

009:012 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and
        in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the
        way wherein they should go.

009:013 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them
        from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws,
        good statutes and commandments:

009:014 And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst
        them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy
        servant:

009:015 And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and
        broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their
        thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess
        the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.

009:016 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their
        necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,

009:017 And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that
        thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their
        rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but
        thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to
        anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.

009:018 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is
        thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought
        great provocations;

009:019 Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the
        wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by
        day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by
        night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.

009:020 Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and
        withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them
        water for their thirst.

009:021 Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so
        that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and
        their feet swelled not.

009:022 Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst
        divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon,
        and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king
        of Bashan.

009:023 Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven,
        and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst
        promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess
        it.

009:024 So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou
        subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the
        Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their
        kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with
        them as they would.

009:025 And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed
        houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and
        oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and
        were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy
        great goodness.

009:026 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee,
        and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets
        which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they
        wrought great provocations.

009:027 Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their
        enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble,
        when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and
        according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours,
        who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.

009:028 But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee:
        therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so
        that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned,
        and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many
        times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;

009:029 And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them
        again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not
        unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments,
        (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the
        shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.

009:030 Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst
        against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not
        give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the
        people of the lands.

009:031 Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not
        utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a
        gracious and merciful God.

009:032 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the
        terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the
        trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on
        our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our
        prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the
        time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.

009:033 Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou
        hast done right, but we have done wickedly:

009:034 Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our
        fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and
        thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.

009:035 For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy
        great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat
        land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from
        their wicked works.

009:036 Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou
        gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good
        thereof, behold, we are servants in it:

009:037 And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast
        set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over
        our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are
        in great distress.

009:038 And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it;
        and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.

010:001 Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son
        of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,

010:002 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,

010:003 Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah,

010:004 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,

010:005 Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,

010:006 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,

010:007 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,

010:008 Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the priests.

010:009 And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the
        sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;

010:010 And their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah,
        Hanan,

010:011 Micha, Rehob, Hashabiah,

010:012 Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,

010:013 Hodijah, Bani, Beninu.

010:014 The chief of the people; Parosh, Pahathmoab, Elam, Zatthu,
        Bani,

010:015 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,

010:016 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,

010:017 Ater, Hizkijah, Azzur,

010:018 Hodijah, Hashum, Bezai,

010:019 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,

010:020 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,

010:021 Meshezabeel, Zadok, Jaddua,

010:022 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,

010:023 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hashub,

010:024 Hallohesh, Pileha, Shobek,

010:025 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,

010:026 And Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,

010:027 Malluch, Harim, Baanah.

010:028 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the
        porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had
        separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law
        of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every
        one having knowledge, and having understanding;

010:029 They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a
        curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given
        by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the
        commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his
        statutes;

010:030 And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of
        the land, not take their daughters for our sons:

010:031 And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on
        the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on
        the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the
        seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.

010:032 Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly
        with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house
        of our God;

010:033 For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and
        for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new
        moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for
        the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all
        the work of the house of our God.

010:034 And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the
        people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of
        our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed
        year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as
        it is written in the law:

010:035 And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the
        firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the
        house of the LORD:

010:036 Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is
        written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our
        flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests
        that minister in the house of our God:

010:037 And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our
        offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and
        of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our
        God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the
        same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our
        tillage.

010:038 And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites,
        when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up
        the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the
        chambers, into the treasure house.

010:039 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall
        bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil,
        unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and
        the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers:
        and we will not forsake the house of our God.

011:001 And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of
        the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in
        Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other
        cities.

011:002 And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered
        themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.

011:003 Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in
        Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his
        possession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and
        the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's
        servants.

011:004 And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and
        of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah
        the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah,
        the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, of the children
        of Perez;

011:005 And Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Colhozeh, the son
        of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of
        Zechariah, the son of Shiloni.

011:006 All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four
        hundred threescore and eight valiant men.

011:007 And these are the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of
        Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of
        Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of
        Jesaiah.

011:008 And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.

011:009 And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer: and Judah the
        son of Senuah was second over the city.

011:010 Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin.

011:011 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of
        Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler
        of the house of God.

011:012 And their brethren that did the work of the house were eight
        hundred twenty and two: and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son
        of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of
        Pashur, the son of Malchiah.

011:013 And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and
        two: and Amashai the son of Azareel, the son of Ahasai, the
        son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,

011:014 And their brethren, mighty men of valour, an hundred twenty
        and eight: and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of one of
        the great men.

011:015 Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of
        Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;

011:016 And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had
        the oversight of the outward business of the house of God.

011:017 And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of
        Asaph, was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer:
        and Bakbukiah the second among his brethren, and Abda the son
        of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.

011:018 All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore
        and four.

011:019 Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that
        kept the gates, were an hundred seventy and two.

011:020 And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites,
        were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.

011:021 But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over
        the Nethinims.

011:022 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son
        of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son
        of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the
        business of the house of God.

011:023 For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a
        certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day.

011:024 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah
        the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters
        concerning the people.

011:025 And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children
        of Judah dwelt at Kirjatharba, and in the villages thereof,
        and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel,
        and in the villages thereof,

011:026 And at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Bethphelet,

011:027 And at Hazarshual, and at Beersheba, and in the villages
        thereof,

011:028 And at Ziklag, and at Mekonah, and in the villages thereof,

011:029 And at Enrimmon, and at Zareah, and at Jarmuth,

011:030 Zanoah, Adullam, and in their villages, at Lachish, and the
        fields thereof, at Azekah, and in the villages thereof. And
        they dwelt from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom.

011:031 The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and
        Aija, and Bethel, and in their villages.

011:032 And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,

011:033 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,

011:034 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,

011:035 Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.

011:036 And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.

012:001 Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with
        Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah,
        Jeremiah, Ezra,

012:002 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,

012:003 Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

012:004 Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,

012:005 Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,

012:006 Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,

012:007 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chief of the
        priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.

012:008 Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah,
        Judah, and Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and
        his brethren.

012:009 Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against
        them in the watches.

012:010 And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and
        Eliashib begat Joiada,

012:011 And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.

012:012 And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the
        fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;

012:013 Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;

012:014 Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

012:015 Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;

012:016 Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

012:017 Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai:

012:018 Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

012:019 And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;

012:020 Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

012:021 Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.

012:022 The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
        Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests,
        to the reign of Darius the Persian.

012:023 The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in
        the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the
        son of Eliashib.

012:024 And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua
        the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to
        praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of
        David the man of God, ward over against ward.

012:025 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,
        were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.

012:026 These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son
        of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of
        Ezra the priest, the scribe.

012:027 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the
        Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem,
        to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings,
        and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.

012:028 And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both
        out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the
        villages of Netophathi;

012:029 Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba
        and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round
        about Jerusalem.

012:030 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and
        purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.

012:031 Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and
        appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks,
        whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the
        dung gate:

012:032 And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of
        Judah,

012:033 And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,

012:034 Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,

012:035 And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely,
        Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of
        Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of
        Asaph:

012:036 And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai,
        Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical
        instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe
        before them.

012:037 And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they
        went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of
        the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate
        eastward.

012:038 And the other company of them that gave thanks went over
        against them, and I after them, and the half of the people
        upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto
        the broad wall;

012:039 And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate,
        and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the
        tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still
        in the prison gate.

012:040 So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the
        house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:

012:041 And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah,
        Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;

012:042 And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and
        Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers
        sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.

012:043 Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for
        God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and
        the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard
        even afar off.

012:044 And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
        treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the
        tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities
        the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah
        rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.

012:045 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their
        God, and the ward of the purification, according to the
        commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.

012:046 For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of
        the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.

012:047 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of
        Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters,
        every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto
        the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children
        of Aaron.

013:001 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of
        the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite
        and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God
        for ever;

013:002 Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and
        with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should
        curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.

013:003 Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they
        separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.

013:004 And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of
        the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:

013:005 And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime
        they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the
        vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the
        oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the
        singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.

013:006 But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two
        and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto
        the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:

013:007 And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that
        Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the
        courts of the house of God.

013:008 And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the
        household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.

013:009 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither
        brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat
        offering and the frankincense.

013:010 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
        given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the
        work, were fled every one to his field.

013:011 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house
        of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in
        their place.

013:012 Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine
        and the oil unto the treasuries.

013:013 And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the
        priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and
        next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of
        Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office
        was to distribute unto their brethren.

013:014 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my
        good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for
        the offices thereof.

013:015 In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the
        sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also
        wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they
        brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified
        against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.

013:016 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and
        all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children
        of Judah, and in Jerusalem.

013:017 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them,
        What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath
        day?

013:018 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this
        evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon
        Israel by profaning the sabbath.

013:019 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to
        be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should
        be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after
        the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that
        there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.

013:020 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged
        without Jerusalem once or twice.

013:021 Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge
        ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you.
        From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.

013:022 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse
        themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to
        sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning
        this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy
        mercy.

013:023 In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of
        Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:

013:024 And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and
        could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the
        language of each people.

013:025 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain
        of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by
        God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons,
        nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.

013:026 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among
        many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of
        his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless
        even him did outlandish women cause to sin.

013:027 Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to
        transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?

013:028 And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high
        priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I
        chased him from me.

013:029 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the
        priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the
        Levites.

013:030 Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the
        wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his
        business;

013:031 And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the
        firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

Book 17	Esther

001:001 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is
        Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over
        an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)

001:002 That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne
        of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,

001:003 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his
        princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the
        nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:

001:004 When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the
        honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and
        fourscore days.

001:005 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto
        all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both
        unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden
        of the king's palace;

001:006 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with
        cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of
        marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of
        red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.

001:007 And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels
        being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance,
        according to the state of the king.

001:008 And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel:
        for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his
        house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.

001:009 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
        house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.

001:010 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with
        wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and
        Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that
        served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,

001:011 To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown
        royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she
        was fair to look on.

001:012 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment
        by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and
        his anger burned in him.

001:013 Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for
        so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and
        judgment:

001:014 And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha,
        Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of
        Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the
        first in the kingdom;)

001:015 What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law,
        because she hath not performed the commandment of the king
        Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?

001:016 And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti
        the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to
        all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the
        provinces of the king Ahasuerus.

001:017 For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women,
        so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when
        it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the
        queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.

001:018 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day
        unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of
        the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.

001:019 If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from
        him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and
        the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more
        before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate
        unto another that is better than she.

001:020 And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be
        published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all
        the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great
        and small.

001:021 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king
        did according to the word of Memucan:

001:022 For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every
        province according to the writing thereof, and to every people
        after their language, that every man should bear rule in his
        own house, and that it should be published according to the
        language of every people.

002:001 After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was
        appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and
        what was decreed against her.

002:002 Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let
        there be fair young virgins sought for the king:

002:003 And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his
        kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young
        virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women,
        unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the
        women; and let their things for purification be given them:

002:004 And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of
        Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.

002:005 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name
        was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of
        Kish, a Benjamite;

002:006 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity
        which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom
        Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.

002:007 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's
        daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid
        was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and
        mother were dead, took for his own daughter.

002:008 So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree
        was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto
        Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was
        brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai,
        keeper of the women.

002:009 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him;
        and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with
        such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were
        meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he
        preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house
        of the women.

002:010 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai
        had charged her that she should not shew it.

002:011 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's
        house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.

002:012 Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king
        Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to
        the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their
        purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of
        myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things
        for the purifying of the women;)

002:013 Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she
        desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the
        women unto the king's house.

002:014 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into
        the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz,
        the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in
        unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and
        that she were called by name.

002:015 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle
        of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to
        go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the
        king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And
        Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked
        upon her.

002:016 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal
        in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh
        year of his reign.

002:017 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she
        obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the
        virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and
        made her queen instead of Vashti.

002:018 Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
        servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the
        provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.

002:019 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time,
        then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.

002:020 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as
        Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of
        Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.

002:021 In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of
        the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which
        kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king
        Ahasuerus.

002:022 And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther
        the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's
        name.

002:023 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;
        therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written
        in the book of the chronicles before the king.

003:001 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
        Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat
        above all the princes that were with him.

003:002 And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate,
        bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded
        concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.

003:003 Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said
        unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?

003:004 Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he
        hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether
        Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he
        was a Jew.

003:005 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him
        reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.

003:006 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they
        had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought
        to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom
        of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.

003:007 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth
        year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot,
        before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the
        twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.

003:008 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
        scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the
        provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all
        people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not
        for the king's profit to suffer them.

003:009 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be
        destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to
        the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to
        bring it into the king's treasuries.

003:010 And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto
        Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.

003:011 And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the
        people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.

003:012 Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of
        the first month, and there was written according to all that
        Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the
        governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of
        every people of every province according to the writing
        thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name
        of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's
        ring.

003:013 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's
        provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all
        Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one
        day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which
        is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.

003:014 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
        province was published unto all people, that they should be
        ready against that day.

003:015 The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment,
        and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king
        and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was
        perplexed.

004:001 When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
        clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into
        the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;

004:002 And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter
        into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.

004:003 And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment
        and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews,
        and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in
        sackcloth and ashes.

004:004 So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her.
        Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment
        to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him:
        but he received it not.

004:005 Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains,
        whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a
        commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.

004:006 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
        which was before the king's gate.

004:007 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and
        of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the
        king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.

004:008 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that
        was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther,
        and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should
        go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to
        make request before him for her people.

004:009 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.

004:010 Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
        Mordecai;

004:011 All the king's servants, and the people of the king's
        provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women,
        shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not
        called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except
        such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that
        he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the
        king these thirty days.

004:012 And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.

004:013 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with
        thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than
        all the Jews.

004:014 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then
        shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from
        another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be
        destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the
        kingdom for such a time as this?

004:015 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,

004:016 Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan,
        and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days,
        night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so
        will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law:
        and if I perish, I perish.

004:017 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther
        had commanded him.

005:001 Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her
        royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's
        house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon
        his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of
        the house.

005:002 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in
        the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king
        held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So
        Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.

005:003 Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and
        what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half
        of the kingdom.

005:004 And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the
        king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have
        prepared for him.

005:005 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do
        as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet
        that Esther had prepared.

005:006 And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is
        thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy
        request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be
        performed.

005:007 Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;

005:008 If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it
        please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my
        request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I
        shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king
        hath said.

005:009 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart:
        but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood
        not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against
        Mordecai.

005:010 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home,
        he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.

005:011 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the
        multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king
        had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the
        princes and servants of the king.

005:012 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come
        in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but
        myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the
        king.

005:013 Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai
        the Jew sitting at the king's gate.

005:014 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a
        gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou
        unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go
        thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing
        pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.

006:001 On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to
        bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were
        read before the king.

006:002 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana
        and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the
        door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.

006:003 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to
        Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that
        ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.

006:004 And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come
        into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the
        king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for
        him.

006:005 And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth
        in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.

006:006 So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be
        done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now
        Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to
        do honour more than to myself?

006:007 And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king
        delighteth to honour,

006:008 Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear,
        and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal
        which is set upon his head:

006:009 And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one
        of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man
        withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on
        horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before
        him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth
        to honour.

006:010 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel
        and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai
        the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of
        all that thou hast spoken.

006:011 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed
        Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of
        the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done
        unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.

006:012 And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted
        to his house mourning, and having his head covered.

006:013 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing
        that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his
        wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before
        whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against
        him, but shalt surely fall before him.

006:014 And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's
        chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that
        Esther had prepared.

007:001 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.

007:002 And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the
        banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it
        shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall
        be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.

007:003 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found
        favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my
        life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:

007:004 For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be
        slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and
        bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not
        countervail the king's damage.

007:005 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the
        queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his
        heart to do so?

007:006 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.
        Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.

007:007 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath
        went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make
        request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that
        there was evil determined against him by the king.

007:008 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place
        of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed
        whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the
        queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of
        king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.

007:009 And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,
        Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had
        made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in
        the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.

007:010 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
        Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.

008:001 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the
        Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before
        the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.

008:002 And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman,
        and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the
        house of Haman.

008:003 And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at
        his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief
        of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised
        against the Jews.

008:004 Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So
        Esther arose, and stood before the king,

008:005 And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his
        sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be
        pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters
        devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he
        wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's
        provinces:

008:006 For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my
        people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my
        kindred?

008:007 Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to
        Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of
        Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he
        laid his hand upon the Jews.

008:008 Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's
        name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which
        is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's
        ring, may no man reverse.

008:009 Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third
        month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth
        day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai
        commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the
        deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto
        Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every
        province according to the writing thereof, and unto every
        people after their language, and to the Jews according to
        their writing, and according to their language.

008:010 And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with
        the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and
        riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:

008:011 Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to
        gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to
        destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the
        people and province that would assault them, both little ones
        and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,

008:012 Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely,
        upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the
        month Adar.

008:013 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
        province was published unto all people, and that the Jews
        should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their
        enemies.

008:014 So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being
        hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the
        decree was given at Shushan the palace.

008:015 And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
        apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and
        with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of
        Shushan rejoiced and was glad.

008:016 The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.

008:017 And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the
        king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and
        gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of
        the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.

009:001 Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the
        thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and
        his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that
        the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though
        it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over
        them that hated them;)

009:002 The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities
        throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay
        hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand
        them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.

009:003 And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and
        the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews;
        because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.

009:004 For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went
        out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed
        greater and greater.

009:005 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
        sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would
        unto those that hated them.

009:006 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five
        hundred men.

009:007 And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

009:008 And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,

009:009 And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,

009:010 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the
        Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.

009:011 On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the
        palace was brought before the king.

009:012 And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain
        and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the
        ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the
        king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be
        granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be
        done.

009:013 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to
        the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according
        unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged
        upon the gallows.

009:014 And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was
        given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.

009:015 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together
        on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three
        hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their
        hand.

009:016 But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered
        themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest
        from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five
        thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,

009:017 On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth
        day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and
        gladness.

009:018 But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
        thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on
        the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day
        of feasting and gladness.

009:019 Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled
        towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of
        gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions
        one to another.

009:020 And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the
        Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,
        both nigh and far,

009:021 To stablish this among them, that they should keep the
        fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the
        same, yearly,

009:022 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and
        the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and
        from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days
        of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another,
        and gifts to the poor.

009:023 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as
        Mordecai had written unto them;

009:024 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of
        all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them,
        and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to
        destroy them;

009:025 But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters
        that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews,
        should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons
        should be hanged on the gallows.

009:026 Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
        Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which
        they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto
        them,

009:027 The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed,
        and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it
        should not fail, that they would keep these two days according
        to their writing, and according to their appointed time every
        year;

009:028 And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout
        every generation, every family, every province, and every
        city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among
        the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.

009:029 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai
        the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second
        letter of Purim.

009:030 And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred
        twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with
        words of peace and truth,

009:031 To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed,
        according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had
        enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for
        their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.

009:032 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and
        it was written in the book.

010:001 And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon
        the isles of the sea.

010:002 And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the
        declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king
        advanced him, are they not written in the book of the
        chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?

010:003 For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great
        among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren,
        seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all
        his seed.

Book 18	Job

001:001 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and
        that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and
        eschewed evil.

001:002 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.

001:003 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three
        thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five
        hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this
        man was the greatest of all the men of the east.

001:004 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his
        day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to
        drink with them.

001:005 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone
        about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in
        the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the
        number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have
        sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job
        continually.

001:006 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
        themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.

001:007 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
        answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the
        earth, and from walking up and down in it.

001:008 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
        Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
        an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?

001:009 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for
        nought?

001:010 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house,
        and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed
        the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the
        land.

001:011 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and
        he will curse thee to thy face.

001:012 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in
        thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So
        Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.

001:013 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were
        eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:

001:014 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were
        plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:

001:015 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they
        have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only
        am escaped alone to tell thee.

001:016 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the
        sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am
        escaped alone to tell thee.

001:017 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels,
        and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with
        the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell
        thee.

001:018 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in
        their eldest brother's house:

001:019 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and
        smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the
        young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to
        tell thee.

001:020 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
        fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,

001:021 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
        shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken
        away; blessed be the name of the LORD.

001:022 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

002:001 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
        themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to
        present himself before the LORD.

002:002 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And
        Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in
        the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

002:003 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
        Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
        an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and
        still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me
        against him, to destroy him without cause.

002:004 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all
        that a man hath will he give for his life.

002:005 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his
        flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.

002:006 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but
        save his life.

002:007 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote
        Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.

002:008 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he
        sat down among the ashes.

002:009 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine
        integrity? curse God, and die.

002:010 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish
        women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of
        God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job
        sin with his lips.

002:011 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was
        come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz
        the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
        Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come
        to mourn with him and to comfort him.

002:012 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,
        they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one
        his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.

002:013 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
        nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his
        grief was very great.

003:001 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

003:002 And Job spake, and said,

003:003 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which
        it was said, There is a man child conceived.

003:004 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,
        neither let the light shine upon it.

003:005 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud
        dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

003:006 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
        joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the
        number of the months.

003:007 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come
        therein.

003:008 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise
        up their mourning.

003:009 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for
        light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the
        day:

003:010 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid
        sorrow from mine eyes.

003:011 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost
        when I came out of the belly?

003:012 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should
        suck?

003:013 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have
        slept: then had I been at rest,

003:014 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate
        places for themselves;

003:015 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with
        silver:

003:016 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants
        which never saw light.

003:017 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be
        at rest.

003:018 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of
        the oppressor.

003:019 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from
        his master.

003:020 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life
        unto the bitter in soul;

003:021 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more
        than for hid treasures;

003:022 Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find
        the grave?

003:023 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God
        hath hedged in?

003:024 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured
        out like the waters.

003:025 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that
        which I was afraid of is come unto me.

003:026 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet;
        yet trouble came.

004:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

004:002 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but
        who can withhold himself from speaking?

004:003 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened
        the weak hands.

004:004 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
        strengthened the feeble knees.

004:005 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth
        thee, and thou art troubled.

004:006 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
        uprightness of thy ways?

004:007 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or
        where were the righteous cut off?

004:008 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow
        wickedness, reap the same.

004:009 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his
        nostrils are they consumed.

004:010 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and
        the teeth of the young lions, are broken.

004:011 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's
        whelps are scattered abroad.

004:012 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received
        a little thereof.

004:013 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
        falleth on men,

004:014 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to
        shake.

004:015 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh
        stood up:

004:016 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an
        image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a
        voice, saying,

004:017 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more
        pure than his maker?

004:018 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he
        charged with folly:

004:019 How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose
        foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?

004:020 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for
        ever without any regarding it.

004:021 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,
        even without wisdom.

005:001 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which
        of the saints wilt thou turn?

005:002 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly
        one.

005:003 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his
        habitation.

005:004 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the
        gate, neither is there any to deliver them.

005:005 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of
        the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.

005:006 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth
        trouble spring out of the ground;

005:007 Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.

005:008 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:

005:009 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things
        without number:

005:010 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the
        fields:

005:011 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn
        may be exalted to safety.

005:012 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their
        hands cannot perform their enterprise.

005:013 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of
        the froward is carried headlong.

005:014 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the
        noonday as in the night.

005:015 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and
        from the hand of the mighty.

005:016 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.

005:017 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore
        despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:

005:018 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands
        make whole.

005:019 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there
        shall no evil touch thee.

005:020 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the
        power of the sword.

005:021 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither
        shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.

005:022 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou
        be afraid of the beasts of the earth.

005:023 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and
        the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.

005:024 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and
        thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.

005:025 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine
        offspring as the grass of the earth.

005:026 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of
        corn cometh in in his season.

005:027 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou
        it for thy good.

006:001 But Job answered and said,

006:002 Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid
        in the balances together!

006:003 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
        therefore my words are swallowed up.

006:004 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison
        whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set
        themselves in array against me.

006:005 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox
        over his fodder?

006:006 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there
        any taste in the white of an egg?

006:007 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful
        meat.

006:008 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me
        the thing that I long for!

006:009 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let
        loose his hand, and cut me off!

006:010 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in
        sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words
        of the Holy One.

006:011 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,
        that I should prolong my life?

006:012 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of
        brass?

006:013 Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

006:014 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his
        friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.

006:015 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the
        stream of brooks they pass away;

006:016 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow
        is hid:

006:017 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are
        consumed out of their place.

006:018 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing,
        and perish.

006:019 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for
        them.

006:020 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came
        thither, and were ashamed.

006:021 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are
        afraid.

006:022 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your
        substance?

006:023 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the
        hand of the mighty?

006:024 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to
        understand wherein I have erred.

006:025 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing
        reprove?

006:026 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that
        is desperate, which are as wind?

006:027 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your
        friend.

006:028 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto
        you if I lie.

006:029 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again,
        my righteousness is in it.

006:030 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern
        perverse things?

007:001 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his
        days also like the days of an hireling?

007:002 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling
        looketh for the reward of his work:

007:003 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights
        are appointed to me.

007:004 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be
        gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of
        the day.

007:005 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
        broken, and become loathsome.

007:006 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent
        without hope.

007:007 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see
        good.

007:008 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine
        eyes are upon me, and I am not.

007:009 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth
        down to the grave shall come up no more.

007:010 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place
        know him any more.

007:011 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the
        anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my
        soul.

007:012 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?

007:013 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my
        complaints;

007:014 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through
        visions:

007:015 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my
        life.

007:016 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days
        are vanity.

007:017 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou
        shouldest set thine heart upon him?

007:018 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him
        every moment?

007:019 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I
        swallow down my spittle?

007:020 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of
        men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am
        a burden to myself?

007:021 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away
        my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt
        seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.

008:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

008:002 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the
        words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?

008:003 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert
        justice?

008:004 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them
        away for their transgression;

008:005 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy
        supplication to the Almighty;

008:006 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for
        thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.

008:007 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should
        greatly increase.

008:008 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare
        thyself to the search of their fathers:

008:009 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our
        days upon earth are a shadow:)

008:010 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out
        of their heart?

008:011 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without
        water?

008:012 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it
        withereth before any other herb.

008:013 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's
        hope shall perish:

008:014 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a
        spider's web.

008:015 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall
        hold it fast, but it shall not endure.

008:016 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in
        his garden.

008:017 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of
        stones.

008:018 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him,
        saying, I have not seen thee.

008:019 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall
        others grow.

008:020 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he
        help the evil doers:

008:021 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with
        rejoicing.

008:022 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the
        dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.

009:001 Then Job answered and said,

009:002 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with
        God?

009:003 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a
        thousand.

009:004 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened
        himself against him, and hath prospered?

009:005 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which
        overturneth them in his anger.

009:006 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars
        thereof tremble.

009:007 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up
        the stars.

009:008 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the
        waves of the sea.

009:009 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers
        of the south.

009:010 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders
        without number.

009:011 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but
        I perceive him not.

009:012 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto
        him, What doest thou?

009:013 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop
        under him.

009:014 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to
        reason with him?

009:015 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I
        would make supplication to my judge.

009:016 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not
        believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.

009:017 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds
        without cause.

009:018 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
        bitterness.

009:019 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment,
        who shall set me a time to plead?

009:020 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I
        say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.

009:021 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would
        despise my life.

009:022 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the
        perfect and the wicked.

009:023 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of
        the innocent.

009:024 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth
        the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?

009:025 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see
        no good.

009:026 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that
        hasteth to the prey.

009:027 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my
        heaviness, and comfort myself:

009:028 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold
        me innocent.

009:029 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?

009:030 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so
        clean;

009:031 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes
        shall abhor me.

009:032 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we
        should come together in judgment.

009:033 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his
        hand upon us both.

009:034 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear
        terrify me:

009:035 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with
        me.

010:001 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon
        myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

010:002 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou
        contendest with me.

010:003 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou
        shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the
        counsel of the wicked?

010:004 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?

010:005 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,

010:006 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after
        my sin?

010:007 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can
        deliver out of thine hand.

010:008 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round
        about; yet thou dost destroy me.

010:009 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay;
        and wilt thou bring me into dust again?

010:010 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like
        cheese?

010:011 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me
        with bones and sinews.

010:012 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath
        preserved my spirit.

010:013 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that
        this is with thee.

010:014 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me
        from mine iniquity.

010:015 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I
        not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see
        thou mine affliction;

010:016 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again
        thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.

010:017 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine
        indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.

010:018 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh
        that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!

010:019 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have
        been carried from the womb to the grave.

010:020 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may
        take comfort a little,

010:021 Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of
        darkness and the shadow of death;

010:022 A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of
        death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.

011:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

011:002 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a
        man full of talk be justified?

011:003 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou
        mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?

011:004 For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in
        thine eyes.

011:005 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;

011:006 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they
        are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth
        of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.

011:007 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
        Almighty unto perfection?

011:008 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell;
        what canst thou know?

011:009 The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than
        the sea.

011:010 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can
        hinder him?

011:011 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not
        then consider it?

011:012 For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild
        ass's colt.

011:013 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands
        toward him;

011:014 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not
        wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.

011:015 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou
        shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:

011:016 Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as
        waters that pass away:

011:017 And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt
        shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.

011:018 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou
        shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.

011:019 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;
        yea, many shall make suit unto thee.

011:020 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not
        escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.

012:001 And Job answered and said,

012:002 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.

012:003 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to
        you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

012:004 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and
        he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.

012:005 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised
        in the thought of him that is at ease.

012:006 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God
        are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.

012:007 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the
        fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:

012:008 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes
        of the sea shall declare unto thee.

012:009 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath
        wrought this?

012:010 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the
        breath of all mankind.

012:011 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?

012:012 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days
        understanding.

012:013 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and
        understanding.

012:014 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he
        shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.

012:015 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he
        sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.

012:016 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver
        are his.

012:017 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges
        fools.

012:018 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a
        girdle.

012:019 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.

012:020 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the
        understanding of the aged.

012:021 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength
        of the mighty.

012:022 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out
        to light the shadow of death.

012:023 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth
        the nations, and straiteneth them again.

012:024 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the
        earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there
        is no way.

012:025 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to
        stagger like a drunken man.

013:001 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and
        understood it.

013:002 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto
        you.

013:003 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason
        with God.

013:004 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.

013:005 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be
        your wisdom.

013:006 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my
        lips.

013:007 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?

013:008 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?

013:009 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man
        mocketh another, do ye so mock him?

013:010 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.

013:011 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall
        upon you?

013:012 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies
        of clay.

013:013 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come
        on me what will.

013:014 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in
        mine hand?

013:015 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will
        maintain mine own ways before him.

013:016 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come
        before him.

013:017 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.

013:018 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be
        justified.

013:019 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my
        tongue, I shall give up the ghost.

013:020 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself
        from thee.

013:021 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me
        afraid.

013:022 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer
        thou me.

013:023 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
        transgression and my sin.

013:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine
        enemy?

013:025 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue
        the dry stubble?

013:026 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to
        possess the iniquities of my youth.

013:027 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly
        unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my
        feet.

013:028 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is
        moth eaten.

014:001 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of
        trouble.

014:002 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also
        as a shadow, and continueth not.

014:003 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest
        me into judgment with thee?

014:004 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.

014:005 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are
        with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;

014:006 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as
        an hireling, his day.

014:007 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
        sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not
        cease.

014:008 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
        thereof die in the ground;

014:009 Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth
        boughs like a plant.

014:010 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,
        and where is he?

014:011 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and
        drieth up:

014:012 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no
        more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.

014:013 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest
        keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest
        appoint me a set time, and remember me!

014:014 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my
        appointed time will I wait, till my change come.

014:015 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a
        desire to the work of thine hands.

014:016 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my
        sin?

014:017 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up
        mine iniquity.

014:018 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the
        rock is removed out of his place.

014:019 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which
        grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the
        hope of man.

014:020 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou
        changest his countenance, and sendest him away.

014:021 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are
        brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.

014:022 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within
        him shall mourn.

015:001 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,

015:002 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly
        with the east wind?

015:003 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches
        wherewith he can do no good?

015:004 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.

015:005 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the
        tongue of the crafty.

015:006 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own
        lips testify against thee.

015:007 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before
        the hills?

015:008 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain
        wisdom to thyself?

015:009 What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou,
        which is not in us?

015:010 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder
        than thy father.

015:011 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any
        secret thing with thee?

015:012 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes
        wink at,

015:013 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such
        words go out of thy mouth?

015:014 What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of
        a woman, that he should be righteous?

015:015 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens
        are not clean in his sight.

015:016 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh
        iniquity like water?

015:017 I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will
        declare;

015:018 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid
        it:

015:019 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed
        among them.

015:020 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the
        number of years is hidden to the oppressor.

015:021 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer
        shall come upon him.

015:022 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he
        is waited for of the sword.

015:023 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth
        that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

015:024 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail
        against him, as a king ready to the battle.

015:025 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth
        himself against the Almighty.

015:026 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses
        of his bucklers:

015:027 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh
        collops of fat on his flanks.

015:028 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man
        inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.

015:029 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
        neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the
        earth.

015:030 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up
        his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.

015:031 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall
        be his recompence.

015:032 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall
        not be green.

015:033 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall
        cast off his flower as the olive.

015:034 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire
        shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.

015:035 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their
        belly prepareth deceit.

016:001 Then Job answered and said,

016:002 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye
        all.

016:003 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that
        thou answerest?

016:004 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's
        stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head
        at you.

016:005 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my
        lips should asswage your grief.

016:006 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I
        forbear, what am I eased?

016:007 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my
        company.

016:008 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness
        against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to
        my face.

016:009 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me
        with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

016:010 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me
        upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves
        together against me.

016:011 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into
        the hands of the wicked.

016:012 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also
        taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up
        for his mark.

016:013 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins
        asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the
        ground.

016:014 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me
        like a giant.

016:015 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in
        the dust.

016:016 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow
        of death;

016:017 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.

016:018 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no
        place.

016:019 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on
        high.

016:020 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.

016:021 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth
        for his neighbour!

016:022 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I
        shall not return.

017:001 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are
        ready for me.

017:002 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue
        in their provocation?

017:003 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that
        will strike hands with me?

017:004 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore
        shalt thou not exalt them.

017:005 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his
        children shall fail.

017:006 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I
        was as a tabret.

017:007 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members
        are as a shadow.

017:008 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall
        stir up himself against the hypocrite.

017:009 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath
        clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.

017:010 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot
        find one wise man among you.

017:011 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the
        thoughts of my heart.

017:012 They change the night into day: the light is short because of
        darkness.

017:013 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the
        darkness.

017:014 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm,
        Thou art my mother, and my sister.

017:015 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?

017:016 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest
        together is in the dust.

018:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

018:002 How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and
        afterwards we will speak.

018:003 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your
        sight?

018:004 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken
        for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?

018:005 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark
        of his fire shall not shine.

018:006 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle
        shall be put out with him.

018:007 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own
        counsel shall cast him down.

018:008 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon
        a snare.

018:009 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall
        prevail against him.

018:010 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in
        the way.

018:011 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive
        him to his feet.

018:012 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be
        ready at his side.

018:013 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn
        of death shall devour his strength.

018:014 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it
        shall bring him to the king of terrors.

018:015 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:
        brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

018:016 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his
        branch be cut off.

018:017 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have
        no name in the street.

018:018 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of
        the world.

018:019 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any
        remaining in his dwellings.

018:020 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they
        that went before were affrighted.

018:021 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the
        place of him that knoweth not God.

019:001 Then Job answered and said,

019:002 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with
        words?

019:003 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that
        ye make yourselves strange to me.

019:004 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with
        myself.

019:005 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead
        against me my reproach:

019:006 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me
        with his net.

019:007 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud,
        but there is no judgment.

019:008 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set
        darkness in my paths.

019:009 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my
        head.

019:010 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine
        hope hath he removed like a tree.

019:011 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me
        unto him as one of his enemies.

019:012 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me,
        and encamp round about my tabernacle.

019:013 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are
        verily estranged from me.

019:014 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have
        forgotten me.

019:015 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a
        stranger: I am an alien in their sight.

019:016 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him
        with my mouth.

019:017 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the
        children's sake of mine own body.

019:018 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake
        against me.

019:019 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are
        turned against me.

019:020 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped
        with the skin of my teeth.

019:021 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the
        hand of God hath touched me.

019:022 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my
        flesh?

019:023 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed
        in a book!

019:024 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock
        for ever!

019:025 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at
        the latter day upon the earth:

019:026 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
        flesh shall I see God:

019:027 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and
        not another; though my reins be consumed within me.

019:028 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of
        the matter is found in me?

019:029 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments
        of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.

020:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

020:002 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I
        make haste.

020:003 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my
        understanding causeth me to answer.

020:004 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,

020:005 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the
        hypocrite but for a moment?

020:006 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head
        reach unto the clouds;

020:007 Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which
        have seen him shall say, Where is he?

020:008 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he
        shall be chased away as a vision of the night.

020:009 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither
        shall his place any more behold him.

020:010 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands
        shall restore their goods.

020:011 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie
        down with him in the dust.

020:012 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it
        under his tongue;

020:013 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still
        within his mouth:

020:014 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps
        within him.

020:015 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up
        again: God shall cast them out of his belly.

020:016 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall
        slay him.

020:017 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey
        and butter.

020:018 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not
        swallow it down: according to his substance shall the
        restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.

020:019 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because
        he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;

020:020 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not
        save of that which he desired.

020:021 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man
        look for his goods.

020:022 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:
        every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.

020:023 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of
        his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is
        eating.

020:024 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall
        strike him through.

020:025 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering
        sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.

020:026 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not
        blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left
        in his tabernacle.

020:027 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise
        up against him.

020:028 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall
        flow away in the day of his wrath.

020:029 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
        appointed unto him by God.

021:001 But Job answered and said,

021:002 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.

021:003 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock
        on.

021:004 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why
        should not my spirit be troubled?

021:005 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.

021:006 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on
        my flesh.

021:007 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in
        power?

021:008 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their
        offspring before their eyes.

021:009 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God
        upon them.

021:010 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and
        casteth not her calf.

021:011 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their
        children dance.

021:012 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of
        the organ.

021:013 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to
        the grave.

021:014 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not
        the knowledge of thy ways.

021:015 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what
        profit should we have, if we pray unto him?

021:016 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked
        is far from me.

021:017 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft
        cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows
        in his anger.

021:018 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the
        storm carrieth away.

021:019 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him,
        and he shall know it.

021:020 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the
        wrath of the Almighty.

021:021 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the
        number of his months is cut off in the midst?

021:022 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that
        are high.

021:023 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and
        quiet.

021:024 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with
        marrow.

021:025 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never
        eateth with pleasure.

021:026 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall
        cover them.

021:027 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye
        wrongfully imagine against me.

021:028 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are
        the dwelling places of the wicked?

021:029 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know
        their tokens,

021:030 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they
        shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.

021:031 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him
        what he hath done?

021:032 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the
        tomb.

021:033 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man
        shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.

021:034 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there
        remaineth falsehood?

022:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

022:002 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be
        profitable unto himself?

022:003 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?
        or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?

022:004 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee
        into judgment?

022:005 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?

022:006 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and
        stripped the naked of their clothing.

022:007 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast
        withholden bread from the hungry.

022:008 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the
        honourable man dwelt in it.

022:009 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the
        fatherless have been broken.

022:010 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear
        troubleth thee;

022:011 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters
        cover thee.

022:012 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of
        the stars, how high they are!

022:013 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the
        dark cloud?

022:014 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he
        walketh in the circuit of heaven.

022:015 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?

022:016 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was
        overflown with a flood:

022:017 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty
        do for them?

022:018 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel
        of the wicked is far from me.

022:019 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh
        them to scorn.

022:020 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them
        the fire consumeth.

022:021 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good
        shall come unto thee.

022:022 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his
        words in thine heart.

022:023 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou
        shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.

022:024 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as
        the stones of the brooks.

022:025 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have
        plenty of silver.

022:026 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and
        shalt lift up thy face unto God.

022:027 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee,
        and thou shalt pay thy vows.

022:028 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established
        unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.

022:029 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting
        up; and he shall save the humble person.

022:030 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is
        delivered by the pureness of thine hands.

023:001 Then Job answered and said,

023:002 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than
        my groaning.

023:003 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even
        to his seat!

023:004 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with
        arguments.

023:005 I would know the words which he would answer me, and
        understand what he would say unto me.

023:006 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he
        would put strength in me.

023:007 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be
        delivered for ever from my judge.

023:008 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I
        cannot perceive him:

023:009 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:
        he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:

023:010 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I
        shall come forth as gold.

023:011 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not
        declined.

023:012 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I
        have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary
        food.

023:013 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul
        desireth, even that he doeth.

023:014 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many
        such things are with him.

023:015 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am
        afraid of him.

023:016 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:

023:017 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he
        covered the darkness from my face.

024:001 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they
        that know him not see his days?

024:002 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks,
        and feed thereof.

024:003 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the
        widow's ox for a pledge.

024:004 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
        themselves together.

024:005 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their
        work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food
        for them and for their children.

024:006 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the
        vintage of the wicked.

024:007 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have
        no covering in the cold.

024:008 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace
        the rock for want of a shelter.

024:009 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge
        of the poor.

024:010 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take
        away the sheaf from the hungry;

024:011 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their
        winepresses, and suffer thirst.

024:012 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded
        crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.

024:013 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not
        the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.

024:014 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,
        and in the night is as a thief.

024:015 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
        saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.

024:016 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for
        themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.

024:017 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one
        know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.

024:018 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the
        earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.

024:019 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave
        those which have sinned.

024:020 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;
        he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken
        as a tree.

024:021 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not
        good to the widow.

024:022 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and
        no man is sure of life.

024:023 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth;
        yet his eyes are upon their ways.

024:024 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought
        low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off
        as the tops of the ears of corn.

024:025 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my
        speech nothing worth?

025:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

025:002 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high
        places.

025:003 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his
        light arise?

025:004 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean
        that is born of a woman?

025:005 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars
        are not pure in his sight.

025:006 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which
        is a worm?

026:001 But Job answered and said,

026:002 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest
        thou the arm that hath no strength?

026:003 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast
        thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?

026:004 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from
        thee?

026:005 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the
        inhabitants thereof.

026:006 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

026:007 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth
        the earth upon nothing.

026:008 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is
        not rent under them.

026:009 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his
        cloud upon it.

026:010 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and
        night come to an end.

026:011 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his
        reproof.

026:012 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding
        he smiteth through the proud.

026:013 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath
        formed the crooked serpent.

026:014 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is
        heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

027:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

027:002 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the
        Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;

027:003 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in
        my nostrils;

027:004 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter
        deceit.

027:005 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not
        remove mine integrity from me.

027:006 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart
        shall not reproach me so long as I live.

027:007 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against
        me as the unrighteous.

027:008 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
        when God taketh away his soul?

027:009 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?

027:010 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call
        upon God?

027:011 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the
        Almighty will I not conceal.

027:012 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus
        altogether vain?

027:013 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage
        of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.

027:014 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his
        offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

027:015 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his
        widows shall not weep.

027:016 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as
        the clay;

027:017 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the
        innocent shall divide the silver.

027:018 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the
        keeper maketh.

027:019 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he
        openeth his eyes, and he is not.

027:020 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him
        away in the night.

027:021 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a
        storm hurleth him out of his place.

027:022 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee
        out of his hand.

027:023 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of
        his place.

028:001 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold
        where they fine it.

028:002 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the
        stone.

028:003 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all
        perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.

028:004 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters
        forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away
        from men.

028:005 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is
        turned up as it were fire.

028:006 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust
        of gold.

028:007 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's
        eye hath not seen:

028:008 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion
        passed by it.

028:009 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the
        mountains by the roots.

028:010 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every
        precious thing.

028:011 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is
        hid bringeth he forth to light.

028:012 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of
        understanding?

028:013 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the
        land of the living.

028:014 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not
        with me.

028:015 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
        for the price thereof.

028:016 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious
        onyx, or the sapphire.

028:017 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of
        it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.

028:018 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price
        of wisdom is above rubies.

028:019 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be
        valued with pure gold.

028:020 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of
        understanding?

028:021 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close
        from the fowls of the air.

028:022 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with
        our ears.

028:023 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place
        thereof.

028:024 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the
        whole heaven;

028:025 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters
        by measure.

028:026 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the
        lightning of the thunder:

028:027 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and
        searched it out.

028:028 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is
        wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.

029:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

029:002 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God
        preserved me;

029:003 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I
        walked through darkness;

029:004 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was
        upon my tabernacle;

029:005 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about
        me;

029:006 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out
        rivers of oil;

029:007 When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared
        my seat in the street!

029:008 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose,
        and stood up.

029:009 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their
        mouth.

029:010 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the
        roof of their mouth.

029:011 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye
        saw me, it gave witness to me:

029:012 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless,
        and him that had none to help him.

029:013 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and
        I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

029:014 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as
        a robe and a diadem.

029:015 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.

029:016 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I
        searched out.

029:017 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out
        of his teeth.

029:018 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my
        days as the sand.

029:019 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all
        night upon my branch.

029:020 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.

029:021 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my
        counsel.

029:022 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped
        upon them.

029:023 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their
        mouth wide as for the latter rain.

029:024 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of
        my countenance they cast not down.

029:025 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in
        the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.

030:001 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,
        whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs
        of my flock.

030:002 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in
        whom old age was perished?

030:003 For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the
        wilderness in former time desolate and waste.

030:004 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their
        meat.

030:005 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them
        as after a thief;)

030:006 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth,
        and in the rocks.

030:007 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were
        gathered together.

030:008 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they
        were viler than the earth.

030:009 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.

030:010 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in
        my face.

030:011 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have
        also let loose the bridle before me.

030:012 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and
        they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.

030:013 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no
        helper.

030:014 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the
        desolation they rolled themselves upon me.

030:015 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind:
        and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.

030:016 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction
        have taken hold upon me.

030:017 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews
        take no rest.

030:018 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it
        bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.

030:019 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and
        ashes.

030:020 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and
        thou regardest me not.

030:021 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou
        opposest thyself against me.

030:022 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon
        it, and dissolvest my substance.

030:023 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house
        appointed for all living.

030:024 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though
        they cry in his destruction.

030:025 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul
        grieved for the poor?

030:026 When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I
        waited for light, there came darkness.

030:027 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction
        prevented me.

030:028 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in
        the congregation.

030:029 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.

030:030 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

030:031 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the
        voice of them that weep.

031:001 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon
        a maid?

031:002 For what portion of God is there from above? and what
        inheritance of the Almighty from on high?

031:003 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to
        the workers of iniquity?

031:004 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?

031:005 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to
        deceit;

031:006 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine
        integrity.

031:007 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked
        after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;

031:008 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be
        rooted out.

031:009 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid
        wait at my neighbour's door;

031:010 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down
        upon her.

031:011 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be
        punished by the judges.

031:012 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root
        out all mine increase.

031:013 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my
        maidservant, when they contended with me;

031:014 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth,
        what shall I answer him?

031:015 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one
        fashion us in the womb?

031:016 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused
        the eyes of the widow to fail;

031:017 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath
        not eaten thereof;

031:018 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a
        father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)

031:019 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor
        without covering;

031:020 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed
        with the fleece of my sheep;

031:021 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw
        my help in the gate:

031:022 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be
        broken from the bone.

031:023 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of
        his highness I could not endure.

031:024 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold,
        Thou art my confidence;

031:025 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine
        hand had gotten much;

031:026 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in
        brightness;

031:027 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath
        kissed my hand:

031:028 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I
        should have denied the God that is above.

031:029 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or
        lifted up myself when evil found him:

031:030 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to
        his soul.

031:031 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his
        flesh! we cannot be satisfied.

031:032 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my
        doors to the traveller.

031:033 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine
        iniquity in my bosom:

031:034 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families
        terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?

031:035 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the
        Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written
        a book.

031:036 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a
        crown to me.

031:037 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince
        would I go near unto him.

031:038 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise
        thereof complain;

031:039 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have
        caused the owners thereof to lose their life:

031:040 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of
        barley. The words of Job are ended.

032:001 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was
        righteous in his own eyes.

032:002 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the
        Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath
        kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.

032:003 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because
        they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.

032:004 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were
        elder than he.

032:005 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
        three men, then his wrath was kindled.

032:006 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I
        am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and
        durst not shew you mine opinion.

032:007 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach
        wisdom.

032:008 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the
        Almighty giveth them understanding.

032:009 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand
        judgment.

032:010 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine
        opinion.

032:011 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,
        whilst ye searched out what to say.

032:012 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you
        that convinced Job, or that answered his words:

032:013 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth
        him down, not man.

032:014 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I
        answer him with your speeches.

032:015 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off
        speaking.

032:016 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and
        answered no more;)

032:017 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine
        opinion.

032:018 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.

032:019 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to
        burst like new bottles.

032:020 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and
        answer.

032:021 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let
        me give flattering titles unto man.

032:022 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker
        would soon take me away.

033:001 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to
        all my words.

033:002 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in
        my mouth.

033:003 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips
        shall utter knowledge clearly.

033:004 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
        hath given me life.

033:005 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me,
        stand up.

033:006 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am
        formed out of the clay.

033:007 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my
        hand be heavy upon thee.

033:008 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the
        voice of thy words, saying,

033:009 I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is
        there iniquity in me.

033:010 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for
        his enemy,

033:011 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.

033:012 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that
        God is greater than man.

033:013 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of
        any of his matters.

033:014 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.

033:015 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth
        upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;

033:016 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their
        instruction,

033:017 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from
        man.

033:018 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from
        perishing by the sword.

033:019 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude
        of his bones with strong pain:

033:020 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.

033:021 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his
        bones that were not seen stick out.

033:022 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the
        destroyers.

033:023 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a
        thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:

033:024 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from
        going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.

033:025 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to
        the days of his youth:

033:026 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him:
        and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto
        man his righteousness.

033:027 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and
        perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;

033:028 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life
        shall see the light.

033:029 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,

033:030 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with
        the light of the living.

033:031 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will
        speak.

033:032 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire
        to justify thee.

033:033 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach
        thee wisdom.

034:001 Furthermore Elihu answered and said,

034:002 Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that
        have knowledge.

034:003 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.

034:004 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what
        is good.

034:005 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my
        judgment.

034:006 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without
        transgression.

034:007 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?

034:008 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and
        walketh with wicked men.

034:009 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should
        delight himself with God.

034:010 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it
        from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty,
        that he should commit iniquity.

034:011 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause
        every man to find according to his ways.

034:012 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the
        Almighty pervert judgment.

034:013 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath
        disposed the whole world?

034:014 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his
        spirit and his breath;

034:015 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto
        dust.

034:016 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the
        voice of my words.

034:017 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn
        him that is most just?

034:018 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes,
        Ye are ungodly?

034:019 How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of
        princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they
        all are the work of his hands.

034:020 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled
        at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away
        without hand.

034:021 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his
        goings.

034:022 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers
        of iniquity may hide themselves.

034:023 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should
        enter into judgment with God.

034:024 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set
        others in their stead.

034:025 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in
        the night, so that they are destroyed.

034:026 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;

034:027 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any
        of his ways:

034:028 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and
        he heareth the cry of the afflicted.

034:029 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when
        he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be
        done against a nation, or against a man only:

034:030 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.

034:031 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne
        chastisement, I will not offend any more:

034:032 That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I
        will do no more.

034:033 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,
        whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I:
        therefore speak what thou knowest.

034:034 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken
        unto me.

034:035 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without
        wisdom.

034:036 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his
        answers for wicked men.

034:037 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands
        among us, and multiplieth his words against God.

035:001 Elihu spake moreover, and said,

035:002 Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My
        righteousness is more than God's?

035:003 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and,
        What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?

035:004 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.

035:005 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which
        are higher than thou.

035:006 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy
        transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?

035:007 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth
        he of thine hand?

035:008 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy
        righteousness may profit the son of man.

035:009 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the
        oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the
        mighty.

035:010 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the
        night;

035:011 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh
        us wiser than the fowls of heaven?

035:012 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride
        of evil men.

035:013 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty
        regard it.

035:014 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is
        before him; therefore trust thou in him.

035:015 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger;
        yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:

035:016 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth
        words without knowledge.

036:001 Elihu also proceeded, and said,

036:002 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to
        speak on God's behalf.

036:003 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe
        righteousness to my Maker.

036:004 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in
        knowledge is with thee.

036:005 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in
        strength and wisdom.

036:006 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to
        the poor.

036:007 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings
        are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever,
        and they are exalted.

036:008 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of
        affliction;

036:009 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that
        they have exceeded.

036:010 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that
        they return from iniquity.

036:011 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in
        prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

036:012 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they
        shall die without knowledge.

036:013 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when
        he bindeth them.

036:014 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.

036:015 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their
        ears in oppression.

036:016 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a
        broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which
        should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.

036:017 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment
        and justice take hold on thee.

036:018 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his
        stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.

036:019 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of
        strength.

036:020 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.

036:021 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen
        rather than affliction.

036:022 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?

036:023 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast
        wrought iniquity?

036:024 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.

036:025 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.

036:026 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the
        number of his years be searched out.

036:027 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain
        according to the vapour thereof:

036:028 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.

036:029 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the
        noise of his tabernacle?

036:030 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the
        bottom of the sea.

036:031 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in
        abundance.

036:032 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to
        shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.

036:033 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also
        concerning the vapour.

037:001 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his
        place.

037:002 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that
        goeth out of his mouth.

037:003 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto
        the ends of the earth.

037:004 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his
        excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.

037:005 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth
        he, which we cannot comprehend.

037:006 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to
        the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.

037:007 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his
        work.

037:008 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.

037:009 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the
        north.

037:010 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the
        waters is straitened.

037:011 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth
        his bright cloud:

037:012 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do
        whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in
        the earth.

037:013 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his
        land, or for mercy.

037:014 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the
        wondrous works of God.

037:015 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of
        his cloud to shine?

037:016 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous
        works of him which is perfect in knowledge?

037:017 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the
        south wind?

037:018 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as
        a molten looking glass?

037:019 Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our
        speech by reason of darkness.

037:020 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he
        shall be swallowed up.

037:021 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds:
        but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.

037:022 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible
        majesty.

037:023 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent
        in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will
        not afflict.

037:024 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise
        of heart.

038:001 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

038:002 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?

038:003 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee,
        and answer thou me.

038:004 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
        declare, if thou hast understanding.

038:005 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who
        hath stretched the line upon it?

038:006 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid
        the corner stone thereof;

038:007 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
        shouted for joy?

038:008 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if
        it had issued out of the womb?

038:009 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness
        a swaddlingband for it,

038:010 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,

038:011 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here
        shall thy proud waves be stayed?

038:012 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the
        dayspring to know his place;

038:013 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the
        wicked might be shaken out of it?

038:014 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.

038:015 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high
        arm shall be broken.

038:016 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou
        walked in the search of the depth?

038:017 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou
        seen the doors of the shadow of death?

038:018 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou
        knowest it all.

038:019 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,
        where is the place thereof,

038:020 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that
        thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?

038:021 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the
        number of thy days is great?

038:022 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou
        seen the treasures of the hail,

038:023 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the
        day of battle and war?

038:024 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east
        wind upon the earth?

038:025 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,
        or a way for the lightning of thunder;

038:026 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the
        wilderness, wherein there is no man;

038:027 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud
        of the tender herb to spring forth?

038:028 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?

038:029 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven,
        who hath gendered it?

038:030 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep
        is frozen.

038:031 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
        bands of Orion?

038:032 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou
        guide Arcturus with his sons?

038:033 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the
        dominion thereof in the earth?

038:034 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of
        waters may cover thee?

038:035 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto
        thee, Here we are?

038:036 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given
        understanding to the heart?

038:037 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the
        bottles of heaven,

038:038 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast
        together?

038:039 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of
        the young lions,

038:040 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie
        in wait?

038:041 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry
        unto God, they wander for lack of meat.

039:001 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring
        forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?

039:002 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou
        the time when they bring forth?

039:003 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they
        cast out their sorrows.

039:004 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;
        they go forth, and return not unto them.

039:005 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the
        bands of the wild ass?

039:006 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land
        his dwellings.

039:007 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he
        the crying of the driver.

039:008 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth
        after every green thing.

039:009 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy
        crib?

039:010 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or
        will he harrow the valleys after thee?

039:011 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt
        thou leave thy labour to him?

039:012 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and
        gather it into thy barn?

039:013 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and
        feathers unto the ostrich?

039:014 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,

039:015 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild
        beast may break them.

039:016 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were
        not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;

039:017 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he
        imparted to her understanding.

039:018 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the
        horse and his rider.

039:019 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck
        with thunder?

039:020 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his
        nostrils is terrible.

039:021 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he
        goeth on to meet the armed men.

039:022 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he
        back from the sword.

039:023 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the
        shield.

039:024 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither
        believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.

039:025 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the
        battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the
        shouting.

039:026 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward
        the south?

039:027 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on
        high?

039:028 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the
        rock, and the strong place.

039:029 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar
        off.

039:030 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are,
        there is she.

040:001 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,

040:002 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he
        that reproveth God, let him answer it.

040:003 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

040:004 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine
        hand upon my mouth.

040:005 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I
        will proceed no further.

040:006 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and
        said,

040:007 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and
        declare thou unto me.

040:008 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me,
        that thou mayest be righteous?

040:009 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice
        like him?

040:010 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array
        thyself with glory and beauty.

040:011 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that
        is proud, and abase him.

040:012 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread
        down the wicked in their place.

040:013 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in
        secret.

040:014 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand
        can save thee.

040:015 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass
        as an ox.

040:016 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the
        navel of his belly.

040:017 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are
        wrapped together.

040:018 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like
        bars of iron.

040:019 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make
        his sword to approach unto him.

040:020 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the
        beasts of the field play.

040:021 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and
        fens.

040:022 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of
        the brook compass him about.

040:023 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth
        that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.

040:024 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.

041:001 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with
        a cord which thou lettest down?

041:002 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through
        with a thorn?

041:003 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft
        words unto thee?

041:004 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a
        servant for ever?

041:005 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him
        for thy maidens?

041:006 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part
        him among the merchants?

041:007 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with
        fish spears?

041:008 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.

041:009 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down
        even at the sight of him?

041:010 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to
        stand before me?

041:011 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is
        under the whole heaven is mine.

041:012 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely
        proportion.

041:013 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to
        him with his double bridle?

041:014 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible
        round about.

041:015 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close
        seal.

041:016 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

041:017 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they
        cannot be sundered.

041:018 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the
        eyelids of the morning.

041:019 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap
        out.

041:020 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or
        caldron.

041:021 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.

041:022 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy
        before him.

041:023 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in
        themselves; they cannot be moved.

041:024 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of
        the nether millstone.

041:025 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason
        of breakings they purify themselves.

041:026 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear,
        the dart, nor the habergeon.

041:027 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.

041:028 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with
        him into stubble.

041:029 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a
        spear.

041:030 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things
        upon the mire.

041:031 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like
        a pot of ointment.

041:032 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep
        to be hoary.

041:033 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.

041:034 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the
        children of pride.

042:001 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

042:002 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can
        be withholden from thee.

042:003 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore
        have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for
        me, which I knew not.

042:004 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,
        and declare thou unto me.

042:005 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine
        eye seeth thee.

042:006 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.

042:007 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto
        Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is
        kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have
        not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job
        hath.

042:008 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and
        go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt
        offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will
        I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye
        have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my
        servant Job.

042:009 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
        Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them:
        the LORD also accepted Job.

042:010 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for
        his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had
        before.

042:011 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his
        sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance
        before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they
        bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the
        LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of
        money, and every one an earring of gold.

042:012 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his
        beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six
        thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand
        she asses.

042:013 He had also seven sons and three daughters.

042:014 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of
        the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.

042:015 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the
        daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among
        their brethren.

042:016 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his
        sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.

042:017 So Job died, being old and full of days.

Book 19	Psalms

001:001 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
        ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in
        the seat of the scornful.

001:002 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth
        he meditate day and night.

001:003 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
        that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also
        shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

001:004 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind
        driveth away.

001:005 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor
        sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

001:006 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of
        the ungodly shall perish.

002:001 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

002:002 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
        counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed,
        saying,

002:003 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords
        from us.

002:004 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall
        have them in derision.

002:005 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in
        his sore displeasure.

002:006 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

002:007 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou
        art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

002:008 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
        inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy
        possession.

002:009 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them
        in pieces like a potter's vessel.

002:010 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of
        the earth.

002:011 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

002:012 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,
        when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they
        that put their trust in him.

003:001 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they
        that rise up against me.

003:002 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him
        in God. Selah.

003:003 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the
        lifter up of mine head.

003:004 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of
        his holy hill. Selah.

003:005 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.

003:006 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set
        themselves against me round about.

003:007 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all
        mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth
        of the ungodly.

003:008 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy
        people. Selah.

004:001 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast
        enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and
        hear my prayer.

004:002 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?
        how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.

004:003 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for
        himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.

004:004 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon
        your bed, and be still. Selah.

004:005 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in
        the LORD.

004:006 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift
        thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.

004:007 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that
        their corn and their wine increased.

004:008 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD,
        only makest me dwell in safety.

005:001 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.

005:002 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for
        unto thee will I pray.

005:003 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the
        morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

005:004 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
        neither shall evil dwell with thee.

005:005 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all
        workers of iniquity.

005:006 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will
        abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

005:007 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of
        thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy
        temple.

005:008 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
        make thy way straight before my face.

005:009 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part
        is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they
        flatter with their tongue.

005:010 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;
        cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for
        they have rebelled against thee.

005:011 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let
        them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them
        also that love thy name be joyful in thee.

005:012 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt
        thou compass him as with a shield.

006:001 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in
        thy hot displeasure.

006:002 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me;
        for my bones are vexed.

006:003 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?

006:004 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies'
        sake.

006:005 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who
        shall give thee thanks?

006:006 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to
        swim; I water my couch with my tears.

006:007 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because
        of all mine enemies.

006:008 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath
        heard the voice of my weeping.

006:009 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my
        prayer.

006:010 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them
        return and be ashamed suddenly.

007:001 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all
        them that persecute me, and deliver me:

007:002 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while
        there is none to deliver.

007:003 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my
        hands;

007:004 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
        (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

007:005 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him
        tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the
        dust. Selah.

007:006 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the
        rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that
        thou hast commanded.

007:007 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:
        for their sakes therefore return thou on high.

007:008 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according
        to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is
        in me.

007:009 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but
        establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts
        and reins.

007:010 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.

007:011 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked
        every day.

007:012 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow,
        and made it ready.

007:013 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he
        ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.

007:014 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived
        mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

007:015 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch
        which he made.

007:016 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent
        dealing shall come down upon his own pate.

007:017 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and
        will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

008:001 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
        who hast set thy glory above the heavens.

008:002 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
        strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still
        the enemy and the avenger.

008:003 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon
        and the stars, which thou hast ordained;

008:004 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,
        that thou visitest him?

008:005 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and
        hast crowned him with glory and honour.

008:006 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
        thou hast put all things under his feet:

008:007 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

008:008 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
        passeth through the paths of the seas.

008:009 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

009:001 I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew
        forth all thy marvellous works.

009:002 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy
        name, O thou most High.

009:003 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish
        at thy presence.

009:004 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in
        the throne judging right.

009:005 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
        thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.

009:006 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and
        thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with
        them.

009:007 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his
        throne for judgment.

009:008 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall
        minister judgment to the people in uprightness.

009:009 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in
        times of trouble.

009:010 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for
        thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

009:011 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare
        among the people his doings.

009:012 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he
        forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

009:013 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer
        of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates
        of death:

009:014 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the
        daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

009:015 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the
        net which they hid is their own foot taken.

009:016 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the
        wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion.
        Selah.

009:017 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that
        forget God.

009:018 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of
        the poor shall not perish for ever.

009:019 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged
        in thy sight.

009:020 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves
        to be but men. Selah.

010:001 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in
        times of trouble?

010:002 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be
        taken in the devices that they have imagined.

010:003 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth
        the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.

010:004 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not
        seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.

010:005 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out
        of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

010:006 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall
        never be in adversity.

010:007 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his
        tongue is mischief and vanity.

010:008 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the
        secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are
        privily set against the poor.

010:009 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in
        wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he
        draweth him into his net.

010:010 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by
        his strong ones.

010:011 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his
        face; he will never see it.

010:012 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the
        humble.

010:013 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his
        heart, Thou wilt not require it.

010:014 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to
        requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto
        thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.

010:015 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out
        his wickedness till thou find none.

010:016 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished
        out of his land.

010:017 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt
        prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:

010:018 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the
        earth may no more oppress.

011:001 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a
        bird to your mountain?

011:002 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their
        arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the
        upright in heart.

011:003 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

011:004 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in
        heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

011:005 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that
        loveth violence his soul hateth.

011:006 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and
        an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.

011:007 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance
        doth behold the upright.

012:001 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail
        from among the children of men.

012:002 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with
        flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.

012:003 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue
        that speaketh proud things:

012:004 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are
        our own: who is lord over us?

012:005 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,
        now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety
        from him that puffeth at him.

012:006 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a
        furnace of earth, purified seven times.

012:007 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from
        this generation for ever.

012:008 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are
        exalted.

013:001 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt
        thou hide thy face from me?

013:002 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my
        heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

013:003 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I
        sleep the sleep of death;

013:004 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those
        that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

013:005 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy
        salvation.

013:006 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully
        with me.

014:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
        corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that
        doeth good.

014:002 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to
        see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.

014:003 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy:
        there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

014:004 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
        people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

014:005 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of
        the righteous.

014:006 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is
        his refuge.

014:007 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when
        the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob
        shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

015:001 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in
        thy holy hill?

015:002 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
        speaketh the truth in his heart.

015:003 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
        neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

015:004 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth
        them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and
        changeth not.

015:005 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward
        against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never
        be moved.

016:001 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

016:002 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my
        goodness extendeth not to thee;

016:003 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent,
        in whom is all my delight.

016:004 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another
        god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take
        up their names into my lips.

016:005 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
        thou maintainest my lot.

016:006 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a
        goodly heritage.

016:007 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins
        also instruct me in the night seasons.

016:008 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my
        right hand, I shall not be moved.

016:009 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh
        also shall rest in hope.

016:010 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou
        suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

016:011 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness
        of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

017:001 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my
        prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.

017:002 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes
        behold the things that are equal.

017:003 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the
        night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am
        purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

017:004 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have
        kept me from the paths of the destroyer.

017:005 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.

017:006 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline
        thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.

017:007 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy
        right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that
        rise up against them.

017:008 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of
        thy wings,

017:009 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who
        compass me about.

017:010 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they
        speak proudly.

017:011 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their
        eyes bowing down to the earth;

017:012 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a
        young lion lurking in secret places.

017:013 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul
        from the wicked, which is thy sword:

017:014 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
        which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou
        fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and
        leave the rest of their substance to their babes.

017:015 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
        satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

018:001 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.

018:002 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my
        God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the
        horn of my salvation, and my high tower.

018:003 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so
        shall I be saved from mine enemies.

018:004 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly
        men made me afraid.

018:005 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death
        prevented me.

018:006 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God:
        he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before
        him, even into his ears.

018:007 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the
        hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

018:008 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
        mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

018:009 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was
        under his feet.

018:010 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon
        the wings of the wind.

018:011 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about
        him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

018:012 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,
        hail stones and coals of fire.

018:013 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave
        his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

018:014 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot
        out lightnings, and discomfited them.

018:015 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of
        the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast
        of the breath of thy nostrils.

018:016 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

018:017 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which
        hated me: for they were too strong for me.

018:018 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
        my stay.

018:019 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
        because he delighted in me.

018:020 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according
        to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

018:021 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
        departed from my God.

018:022 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away
        his statutes from me.

018:023 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
        iniquity.

018:024 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
        righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his
        eyesight.

018:025 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
        upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

018:026 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
        froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.

018:027 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down
        high looks.

018:028 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten
        my darkness.

018:029 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I
        leaped over a wall.

018:030 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:
        he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.

018:031 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?

018:032 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
        perfect.

018:033 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my
        high places.

018:034 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken
        by mine arms.

018:035 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
        right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me
        great.

018:036 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not
        slip.

018:037 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I
        turn again till they were consumed.

018:038 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are
        fallen under my feet.

018:039 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou
        hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

018:040 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I
        might destroy them that hate me.

018:041 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the
        LORD, but he answered them not.

018:042 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did
        cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

018:043 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and
        thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I
        have not known shall serve me.

018:044 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers
        shall submit themselves unto me.

018:045 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their
        close places.

018:046 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
        salvation be exalted.

018:047 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

018:048 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up
        above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me
        from the violent man.

018:049 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
        heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.

018:050 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to
        his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

019:001 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament
        sheweth his handywork.

019:002 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
        knowledge.

019:003 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not
        heard.

019:004 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words
        to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for
        the sun,

019:005 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and
        rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

019:006 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit
        unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat
        thereof.

019:007 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
        testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.

019:008 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
        commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.

019:009 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the
        judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

019:010 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine
        gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

019:011 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them
        there is great reward.

019:012 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
        faults.

019:013 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them
        not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I
        shall be innocent from the great transgression.

019:014 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
        acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.

020:001 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God
        of Jacob defend thee;

020:002 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
        Zion;

020:003 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
        Selah.

020:004 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy
        counsel.

020:005 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God
        we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

020:006 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him
        from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right
        hand.

020:007 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will
        remember the name of the LORD our God.

020:008 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand
        upright.

020:009 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.

021:001 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy
        salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

021:002 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not
        withholden the request of his lips. Selah.

021:003 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou
        settest a crown of pure gold on his head.

021:004 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of
        days for ever and ever.

021:005 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast
        thou laid upon him.

021:006 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made
        him exceeding glad with thy countenance.

021:007 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of
        the most High he shall not be moved.

021:008 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand
        shall find out those that hate thee.

021:009 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine
        anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the
        fire shall devour them.

021:010 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed
        from among the children of men.

021:011 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a
        mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.

021:012 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou
        shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the
        face of them.

021:013 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing
        and praise thy power.

022:001 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far
        from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

022:002 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in
        the night season, and am not silent.

022:003 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of
        Israel.

022:004 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst
        deliver them.

022:005 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in
        thee, and were not confounded.

022:006 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised
        of the people.

022:007 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the
        lip, they shake the head, saying,

022:008 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him
        deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

022:009 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make
        me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.

022:010 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my
        mother's belly.

022:011 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to
        help.

022:012 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have
        beset me round.

022:013 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a
        roaring lion.

022:014 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:
        my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

022:015 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue
        cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of
        death.

022:016 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have
        inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.

022:017 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.

022:018 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my
        vesture.

022:019 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee
        to help me.

022:020 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of
        the dog.

022:021 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the
        horns of the unicorns.

022:022 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
        congregation will I praise thee.

022:023 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,
        glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

022:024 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
        afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he
        cried unto him, he heard.

022:025 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will
        pay my vows before them that fear him.

022:026 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the
        LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

022:027 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the
        LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before
        thee.

022:028 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among
        the nations.

022:029 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all
        they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none
        can keep alive his own soul.

022:030 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for
        a generation.

022:031 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
        people that shall be born, that he hath done this.

023:001 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.

023:002 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me
        beside the still waters.

023:003 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of
        righteousness for his name's sake.

023:004 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
        I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
        staff they comfort me.

023:005 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
        enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

023:006 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
        life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

024:001 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world,
        and they that dwell therein.

024:002 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon
        the floods.

024:003 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand
        in his holy place?

024:004 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not
        lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

024:005 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness
        from the God of his salvation.

024:006 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy
        face, O Jacob. Selah.

024:007 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye
        everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

024:008 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the
        LORD mighty in battle.

024:009 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye
        everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

024:010 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King
        of glory. Selah.

025:001 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.

025:002 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine
        enemies triumph over me.

025:003 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be
        ashamed which transgress without cause.

025:004 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.

025:005 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
        salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

025:006 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
        for they have been ever of old.

025:007 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
        according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness'
        sake, O LORD.

025:008 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners
        in the way.

025:009 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach
        his way.

025:010 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as
        keep his covenant and his testimonies.

025:011 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is
        great.

025:012 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in
        the way that he shall choose.

025:013 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the
        earth.

025:014 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will
        shew them his covenant.

025:015 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet
        out of the net.

025:016 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate
        and afflicted.

025:017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of
        my distresses.

025:018 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my
        sins.

025:019 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me
        with cruel hatred.

025:020 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I
        put my trust in thee.

025:021 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

025:022 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

026:001 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have
        trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.

026:002 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

026:003 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked
        in thy truth.

026:004 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
        dissemblers.

026:005 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit
        with the wicked.

026:006 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine
        altar, O LORD:

026:007 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of
        all thy wondrous works.

026:008 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place
        where thine honour dwelleth.

026:009 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

026:010 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of
        bribes.

026:011 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and
        be merciful unto me.

026:012 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I
        bless the LORD.

027:001 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
        LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

027:002 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me
        to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

027:003 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not
        fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be
        confident.

027:004 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;
        that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my
        life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his
        temple.

027:005 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion:
        in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set
        me up upon a rock.

027:006 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
        about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices
        of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

027:007 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon
        me, and answer me.

027:008 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee,
        Thy face, LORD, will I seek.

027:009 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in
        anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake
        me, O God of my salvation.

027:010 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will
        take me up.

027:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because
        of mine enemies.

027:012 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
        witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out
        cruelty.

027:013 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of
        the LORD in the land of the living.

027:014 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
        thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.

028:001 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me:
        lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down
        into the pit.

028:002 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when
        I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

028:003 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
        iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief
        is in their hearts.

028:004 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
        wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of
        their hands; render to them their desert.

028:005 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the
        operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build
        them up.

028:006 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
        supplications.

028:007 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in
        him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
        and with my song will I praise him.

028:008 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of
        his anointed.

028:009 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also,
        and lift them up for ever.

029:001 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and
        strength.

029:002 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the
        LORD in the beauty of holiness.

029:003 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory
        thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.

029:004 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is
        full of majesty.

029:005 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD
        breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.

029:006 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion
        like a young unicorn.

029:007 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.

029:008 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh
        the wilderness of Kadesh.

029:009 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and
        discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one
        speak of his glory.

029:010 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King
        for ever.

029:011 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will
        bless his people with peace.

030:001 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and
        hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

030:002 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

030:003 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast
        kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

030:004 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
        remembrance of his holiness.

030:005 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:
        weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

030:006 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

030:007 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand
        strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

030:008 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made
        supplication.

030:009 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
        Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

030:010 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.

030:011 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast
        put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

030:012 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
        silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

031:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:
        deliver me in thy righteousness.

031:002 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my
        strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.

031:003 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's
        sake lead me, and guide me.

031:004 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
        thou art my strength.

031:005 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O
        LORD God of truth.

031:006 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in
        the LORD.

031:007 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast
        considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

031:008 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast
        set my feet in a large room.

031:009 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
        consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.

031:010 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my
        strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are
        consumed.

031:011 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among
        my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did
        see me without fled from me.

031:012 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
        vessel.

031:013 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side:
        while they took counsel together against me, they devised to
        take away my life.

031:014 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.

031:015 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
        enemies, and from them that persecute me.

031:016 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
        mercies' sake.

031:017 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee:
        let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the
        grave.

031:018 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
        things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.

031:019 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
        that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in
        thee before the sons of men!

031:020 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
        pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from
        the strife of tongues.

031:021 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
        kindness in a strong city.

031:022 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
        nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when
        I cried unto thee.

031:023 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth
        the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.

031:024 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye
        that hope in the LORD.

032:001 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
        covered.

032:002 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity,
        and in whose spirit there is no guile.

032:003 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all
        the day long.

032:004 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
        turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

032:005 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
        hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD;
        and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

032:006 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a
        time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great
        waters they shall not come nigh unto him.

032:007 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
        thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

032:008 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou
        shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.

032:009 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
        understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and
        bridle, lest they come near unto thee.

032:010 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in
        the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

032:011 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for
        joy, all ye that are upright in heart.

033:001 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for
        the upright.

033:002 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and
        an instrument of ten strings.

033:003 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.

033:004 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done
        in truth.

033:005 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
        goodness of the LORD.

033:006 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the
        host of them by the breath of his mouth.

033:007 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he
        layeth up the depth in storehouses.

033:008 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of
        the world stand in awe of him.

033:009 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood
        fast.

033:010 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
        maketh the devices of the people of none effect.

033:011 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his
        heart to all generations.

033:012 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people
        whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

033:013 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of
        men.

033:014 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
        inhabitants of the earth.

033:015 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their
        works.

033:016 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty
        man is not delivered by much strength.

033:017 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver
        any by his great strength.

033:018 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
        them that hope in his mercy;

033:019 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
        famine.

033:020 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.

033:021 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in
        his holy name.

033:022 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in
        thee.

034:001 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall
        continually be in my mouth.

034:002 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall
        hear thereof, and be glad.

034:003 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name
        together.

034:004 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all
        my fears.

034:005 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were
        not ashamed.

034:006 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out
        of all his troubles.

034:007 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear
        him, and delivereth them.

034:008 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
        trusteth in him.

034:009 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them
        that fear him.

034:010 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek
        the LORD shall not want any good thing.

034:011 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear
        of the LORD.

034:012 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that
        he may see good?

034:013 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.

034:014 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

034:015 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are
        open unto their cry.

034:016 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off
        the remembrance of them from the earth.

034:017 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them
        out of all their troubles.

034:018 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and
        saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.

034:019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD
        delivereth him out of them all.

034:020 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

034:021 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous
        shall be desolate.

034:022 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them
        that trust in him shall be desolate.

035:001 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight
        against them that fight against me.

035:002 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

035:003 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that
        persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

035:004 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my
        soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that
        devise my hurt.

035:005 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the
        LORD chase them.

035:006 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the
        LORD persecute them.

035:007 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit,
        which without cause they have digged for my soul.

035:008 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net
        that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let
        him fall.

035:009 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in
        his salvation.

035:010 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which
        deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea,
        the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?

035:011 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things
        that I knew not.

035:012 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.

035:013 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth:
        I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into
        mine own bosom.

035:014 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I
        bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.

035:015 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
        together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together
        against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased
        not:

035:016 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with
        their teeth.

035:017 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
        destructions, my darling from the lions.

035:018 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will
        praise thee among much people.

035:019 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
        neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a
        cause.

035:020 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters
        against them that are quiet in the land.

035:021 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,
        aha, our eye hath seen it.

035:022 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not
        far from me.

035:023 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,
        my God and my Lord.

035:024 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and
        let them not rejoice over me.

035:025 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let
        them not say, We have swallowed him up.

035:026 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that
        rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and
        dishonour that magnify themselves against me.

035:027 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous
        cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be
        magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
        servant.

035:028 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy
        praise all the day long.

036:001 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that
        there is no fear of God before his eyes.

036:002 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity
        be found to be hateful.

036:003 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left
        off to be wise, and to do good.

036:004 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way
        that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

036:005 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness
        reacheth unto the clouds.

036:006 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments
        are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

036:007 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
        children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.

036:008 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy
        house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy
        pleasures.

036:009 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we
        see light.

036:010 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and
        thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

036:011 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the
        hand of the wicked remove me.

036:012 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,
        and shall not be able to rise.

037:001 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
        against the workers of iniquity.

037:002 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as
        the green herb.

037:003 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the
        land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

037:004 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the
        desires of thine heart.

037:005 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall
        bring it to pass.

037:006 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and
        thy judgment as the noonday.

037:007 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
        because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man
        who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

037:008 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any
        wise to do evil.

037:009 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
        LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

037:010 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou
        shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.

037:011 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
        themselves in the abundance of peace.

037:012 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him
        with his teeth.

037:013 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
        coming.

037:014 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
        to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of
        upright conversation.

037:015 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows
        shall be broken.

037:016 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches
        of many wicked.

037:017 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD
        upholdeth the righteous.

037:018 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their
        inheritance shall be for ever.

037:019 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
        famine they shall be satisfied.

037:020 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
        be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall
        they consume away.

037:021 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous
        sheweth mercy, and giveth.

037:022 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and
        they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.

037:023 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he
        delighteth in his way.

037:024 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the
        LORD upholdeth him with his hand.

037:025 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
        righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

037:026 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.

037:027 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

037:028 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints;
        they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall
        be cut off.

037:029 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
        ever.

037:030 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue
        talketh of judgment.

037:031 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall
        slide.

037:032 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

037:033 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when
        he is judged.

037:034 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
        inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see
        it.

037:035 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
        like a green bay tree.

037:036 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him,
        but he could not be found.

037:037 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of
        that man is peace.

037:038 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of
        the wicked shall be cut off.

037:039 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their
        strength in the time of trouble.

037:040 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall
        deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they
        trust in him.

038:001 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy
        hot displeasure.

038:002 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me
        sore.

038:003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;
        neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

038:004 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy
        burden they are too heavy for me.

038:005 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.

038:006 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the
        day long.

038:007 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is
        no soundness in my flesh.

038:008 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the
        disquietness of my heart.

038:009 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid
        from thee.

038:010 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of
        mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

038:011 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my
        kinsmen stand afar off.

038:012 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they
        that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine
        deceits all the day long.

038:013 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
        openeth not his mouth.

038:014 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are
        no reproofs.

038:015 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

038:016 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over
        me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.

038:017 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before
        me.

038:018 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

038:019 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they
        that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

038:020 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
        because I follow the thing that good is.

038:021 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.

038:022 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.

039:001 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
        tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked
        is before me.

039:002 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and
        my sorrow was stirred.

039:003 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire
        burned: then spake I with my tongue,

039:004 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days,
        what it is: that I may know how frail I am.

039:005 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age
        is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state
        is altogether vanity. Selah.

039:006 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are
        disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who
        shall gather them.

039:007 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.

039:008 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the
        reproach of the foolish.

039:009 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.

039:010 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of
        thine hand.

039:011 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou
        makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every
        man is vanity. Selah.

039:012 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy
        peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a
        sojourner, as all my fathers were.

039:013 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence,
        and be no more.

040:001 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and
        heard my cry.

040:002 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
        clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

040:003 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our
        God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

040:004 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and
        respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

040:005 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
        done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be
        reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak
        of them, they are more than can be numbered.

040:006 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast
        thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not
        required.

040:007 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
        written of me,

040:008 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
        heart.

040:009 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I
        have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

040:010 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
        declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not
        concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great
        congregation.

040:011 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
        lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

040:012 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities
        have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;
        they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart
        faileth me.

040:013 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help
        me.

040:014 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
        soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to
        shame that wish me evil.

040:015 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
        me, Aha, aha.

040:016 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let
        such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be
        magnified.

040:017 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou
        art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.

041:001 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver
        him in time of trouble.

041:002 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall
        be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto
        the will of his enemies.

041:003 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou
        wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

041:004 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have
        sinned against thee.

041:005 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name
        perish?

041:006 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart
        gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth
        it.

041:007 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do
        they devise my hurt.

041:008 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now
        that he lieth he shall rise up no more.

041:009 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did
        eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.

041:010 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
        may requite them.

041:011 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth
        not triumph over me.

041:012 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and
        settest me before thy face for ever.

041:013 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
        everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

042:001 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
        after thee, O God.

042:002 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I
        come and appear before God?

042:003 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they
        continually say unto me, Where is thy God?

042:004 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I
        had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of
        God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that
        kept holyday.

042:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
        in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the
        help of his countenance.

042:006 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I
        remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites,
        from the hill Mizar.

042:007 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all
        thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.

042:008 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time,
        and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto
        the God of my life.

042:009 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why
        go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

042:010 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
        they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?

042:011 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
        within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who
        is the health of my countenance, and my God.

043:001 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation:
        O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

043:002 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me
        off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

043:003 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them
        bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

043:004 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding
        joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

043:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
        within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the
        health of my countenance, and my God.

044:001 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,
        what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.

044:002 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and
        plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast
        them out.

044:003 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
        neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and
        thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou
        hadst a favour unto them.

044:004 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.

044:005 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name
        will we tread them under that rise up against us.

044:006 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save
        me.

044:007 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to
        shame that hated us.

044:008 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for
        ever. Selah.

044:009 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not
        forth with our armies.

044:010 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which
        hate us spoil for themselves.

044:011 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast
        scattered us among the heathen.

044:012 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy
        wealth by their price.

044:013 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a
        derision to them that are round about us.

044:014 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the
        head among the people.

044:015 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my
        face hath covered me,

044:016 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by
        reason of the enemy and avenger.

044:017 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
        neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

044:018 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined
        from thy way;

044:019 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and
        covered us with the shadow of death.

044:020 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our
        hands to a strange god;

044:021 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of
        the heart.

044:022 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are
        counted as sheep for the slaughter.

044:023 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for
        ever.

044:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction
        and our oppression?

044:025 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth
        unto the earth.

044:026 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.

045:001 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things
        which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a
        ready writer.

045:002 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into
        thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

045:003 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory
        and thy majesty.

045:004 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
        meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach
        thee terrible things.

045:005 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;
        whereby the people fall under thee.

045:006 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
        kingdom is a right sceptre.

045:007 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore
        God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
        above thy fellows.

045:008 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
        the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

045:009 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy
        right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

045:010 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
        forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;

045:011 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy
        Lord; and worship thou him.

045:012 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the
        rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.

045:013 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of
        wrought gold.

045:014 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework:
        the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought
        unto thee.

045:015 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall
        enter into the king's palace.

045:016 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest
        make princes in all the earth.

045:017 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
        therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

046:001 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
        trouble.

046:002 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
        though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

046:003 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
        mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

046:004 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city
        of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

046:005 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall
        help her, and that right early.

046:006 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his
        voice, the earth melted.

046:007 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
        Selah.

046:008 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath
        made in the earth.

046:009 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh
        the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the
        chariot in the fire.

046:010 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the
        heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

046:011 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
        Selah.

047:001 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the
        voice of triumph.

047:002 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over
        all the earth.

047:003 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our
        feet.

047:004 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of
        Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

047:005 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
        trumpet.

047:006 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,
        sing praises.

047:007 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
        understanding.

047:008 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of
        his holiness.

047:009 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the
        people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth
        belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.

048:001 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of
        our God, in the mountain of his holiness.

048:002 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount
        Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

048:003 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

048:004 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.

048:005 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and
        hasted away.

048:006 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in
        travail.

048:007 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

048:008 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
        hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
        Selah.

048:009 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of
        thy temple.

048:010 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends
        of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

048:011 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,
        because of thy judgments.

048:012 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers
        thereof.

048:013 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
        tell it to the generation following.

048:014 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our
        guide even unto death.

049:001 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
        world:

049:002 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

049:003 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
        shall be of understanding.

049:004 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark
        saying upon the harp.

049:005 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity
        of my heels shall compass me about?

049:006 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
        multitude of their riches;

049:007 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to
        God a ransom for him:

049:008 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth
        for ever:)

049:009 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.

049:010 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the
        brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

049:011 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for
        ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call
        their lands after their own names.

049:012 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the
        beasts that perish.

049:013 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve
        their sayings. Selah.

049:014 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on
        them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the
        morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from
        their dwelling.

049:015 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for
        he shall receive me. Selah.

049:016 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of
        his house is increased;

049:017 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall
        not descend after him.

049:018 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise
        thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

049:019 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never
        see light.

049:020 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the
        beasts that perish.

050:001 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the
        earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

050:002 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

050:003 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
        devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round
        about him.

050:004 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth,
        that he may judge his people.

050:005 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a
        covenant with me by sacrifice.

050:006 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is
        judge himself. Selah.

050:007 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will
        testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.

050:008 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
        offerings, to have been continually before me.

050:009 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of
        thy folds.

050:010 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
        thousand hills.

050:011 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of
        the field are mine.

050:012 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is
        mine, and the fulness thereof.

050:013 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

050:014 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
        High:

050:015 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee,
        and thou shalt glorify me.

050:016 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare
        my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
        mouth?

050:017 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind
        thee.

050:018 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
        hast been partaker with adulterers.

050:019 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

050:020 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
        thine own mother's son.

050:021 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou
        thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I
        will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.

050:022 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
        pieces, and there be none to deliver.

050:023 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
        his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.

051:001 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
        according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
        transgressions.

051:002 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
        sin.

051:003 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before
        me.

051:004 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in
        thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,
        and be clear when thou judgest.

051:005 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
        conceive me.

051:006 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
        hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

051:007 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
        shall be whiter than snow.

051:008 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou
        hast broken may rejoice.

051:009 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

051:010 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
        within me.

051:011 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy
        spirit from me.

051:012 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with
        thy free spirit.

051:013 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
        converted unto thee.

051:014 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
        salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy
        righteousness.

051:015 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
        praise.

051:016 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
        delightest not in burnt offering.

051:017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
        contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

051:018 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls
        of Jerusalem.

051:019 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of
        righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering:
        then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

052:001 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the
        goodness of God endureth continually.

052:002 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
        deceitfully.

052:003 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to
        speak righteousness. Selah.

052:004 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.

052:005 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
        away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee
        out of the land of the living. Selah.

052:006 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at
        him:

052:007 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but
        trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
        himself in his wickedness.

052:008 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust
        in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

052:009 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I
        will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.

053:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are
        they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that
        doeth good.

053:002 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see
        if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.

053:003 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become
        filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

053:004 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
        people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.

053:005 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath
        scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou
        hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.

053:006 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When
        God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall
        rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

054:001 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

054:002 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

054:003 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek
        after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

054:004 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold
        my soul.

054:005 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
        truth.

054:006 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O
        LORD; for it is good.

054:007 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath
        seen his desire upon mine enemies.

055:001 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
        supplication.

055:002 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make
        a noise;

055:003 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression
        of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath
        they hate me.

055:004 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death
        are fallen upon me.

055:005 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
        overwhelmed me.

055:006 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I
        fly away, and be at rest.

055:007 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.
        Selah.

055:008 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.

055:009 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen
        violence and strife in the city.

055:010 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
        mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.

055:011 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart
        not from her streets.

055:012 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
        borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify
        himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

055:013 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
        acquaintance.

055:014 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of
        God in company.

055:015 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into
        hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.

055:016 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.

055:017 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
        and he shall hear my voice.

055:018 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
        against me: for there were many with me.

055:019 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.
        Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not
        God.

055:020 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
        him: he hath broken his covenant.

055:021 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was
        in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they
        drawn swords.

055:022 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he
        shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

055:023 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
        destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half
        their days; but I will trust in thee.

056:001 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he
        fighting daily oppresseth me.

056:002 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that
        fight against me, O thou most High.

056:003 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

056:004 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I
        will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

056:005 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against
        me for evil.

056:006 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they
        mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.

056:007 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the
        people, O God.

056:008 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:
        are they not in thy book?

056:009 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this
        I know; for God is for me.

056:010 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his
        word.

056:011 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can
        do unto me.

056:012 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.

056:013 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou
        deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in
        the light of the living?

057:001 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul
        trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make
        my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.

057:002 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all
        things for me.

057:003 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of
        him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his
        mercy and his truth.

057:004 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set
        on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and
        arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

057:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be
        above all the earth.

057:006 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
        they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they
        are fallen themselves. Selah.

057:007 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and
        give praise.

057:008 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will
        awake early.

057:009 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto
        thee among the nations.

057:010 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto
        the clouds.

057:011 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
        above all the earth.

058:001 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
        uprightly, O ye sons of men?

058:002 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of
        your hands in the earth.

058:003 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon
        as they be born, speaking lies.

058:004 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like
        the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;

058:005 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming
        never so wisely.

058:006 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great
        teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

058:007 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he
        bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in
        pieces.

058:008 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away:
        like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the
        sun.

058:009 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away
        as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

058:010 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he
        shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

058:011 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
        righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

059:001 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them
        that rise up against me.

059:002 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from
        bloody men.

059:003 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered
        against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.

059:004 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to
        help me, and behold.

059:005 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake
        to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked
        transgressors. Selah.

059:006 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go
        round about the city.

059:007 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their
        lips: for who, say they, doth hear?

059:008 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the
        heathen in derision.

059:009 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my
        defence.

059:010 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my
        desire upon mine enemies.

059:011 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy
        power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

059:012 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let
        them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying
        which they speak.

059:013 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and
        let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the
        earth. Selah.

059:014 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like
        a dog, and go round about the city.

059:015 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be
        not satisfied.

059:016 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy
        mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge
        in the day of my trouble.

059:017 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,
        and the God of my mercy.

060:001 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou
        hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.

060:002 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal
        the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

060:003 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to
        drink the wine of astonishment.

060:004 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may
        be displayed because of the truth. Selah.

060:005 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand,
        and hear me.

060:006 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
        Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

060:007 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the
        strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

060:008 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe:
        Philistia, triumph thou because of me.

060:009 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
        Edom?

060:010 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O
        God, which didst not go out with our armies?

060:011 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

060:012 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
        tread down our enemies.

061:001 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

061:002 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart
        is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

061:003 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from
        the enemy.

061:004 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the
        covert of thy wings. Selah.

061:005 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the
        heritage of those that fear thy name.

061:006 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many
        generations.

061:007 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,
        which may preserve him.

061:008 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily
        perform my vows.

062:001 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.

062:002 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall
        not be greatly moved.

062:003 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be
        slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a
        tottering fence.

062:004 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they
        delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse
        inwardly. Selah.

062:005 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from
        him.

062:006 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall
        not be moved.

062:007 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,
        and my refuge, is in God.

062:008 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart
        before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

062:009 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree
        are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether
        lighter than vanity.

062:010 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if
        riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

062:011 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power
        belongeth unto God.

062:012 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to
        every man according to his work.

063:001 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul
        thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
        thirsty land, where no water is;

063:002 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
        sanctuary.

063:003 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall
        praise thee.

063:004 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands
        in thy name.

063:005 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
        mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:

063:006 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the
        night watches.

063:007 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy
        wings will I rejoice.

063:008 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth
        me.

063:009 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the
        lower parts of the earth.

063:010 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for
        foxes.

063:011 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by
        him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall
        be stopped.

064:001 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear
        of the enemy.

064:002 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
        insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

064:003 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to
        shoot their arrows, even bitter words:

064:004 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they
        shoot at him, and fear not.

064:005 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of
        laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

064:006 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:
        both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart,
        is deep.

064:007 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they
        be wounded.

064:008 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:
        all that see them shall flee away.

064:009 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for
        they shall wisely consider of his doing.

064:010 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in
        him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

065:001 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall
        the vow be performed.

065:002 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

065:003 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou
        shalt purge them away.

065:004 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach
        unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be
        satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy
        temple.

065:005 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God
        of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of
        the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:

065:006 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded
        with power:

065:007 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their
        waves, and the tumult of the people.

065:008 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
        tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening
        to rejoice.

065:009 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly
        enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water:
        thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

065:010 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the
        furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou
        blessest the springing thereof.

065:011 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
        fatness.

065:012 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little
        hills rejoice on every side.

065:013 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
        covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.

066:001 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:

066:002 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.

066:003 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
        greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves
        unto thee.

066:004 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee;
        they shall sing to thy name. Selah.

066:005 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing
        toward the children of men.

066:006 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood
        on foot: there did we rejoice in him.

066:007 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations:
        let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

066:008 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise
        to be heard:

066:009 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to
        be moved.

066:010 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver
        is tried.

066:011 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon
        our loins.

066:012 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
        fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a
        wealthy place.

066:013 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee
        my vows,

066:014 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I
        was in trouble.

066:015 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the
        incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

066:016 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what
        he hath done for my soul.

066:017 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my
        tongue.

066:018 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:

066:019 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of
        my prayer.

066:020 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his
        mercy from me.

067:001 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to
        shine upon us; Selah.

067:002 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among
        all nations.

067:003 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
        thee.

067:004 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt
        judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon
        earth. Selah.

067:005 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
        thee.

067:006 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own
        God, shall bless us.

067:007 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear
        him.

068:001 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also
        that hate him flee before him.

068:002 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth
        before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of
        God.

068:003 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God:
        yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.

068:004 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth
        upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.

068:005 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God
        in his holy habitation.

068:006 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those
        which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry
        land.

068:007 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou
        didst march through the wilderness; Selah:

068:008 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of
        God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the
        God of Israel.

068:009 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
        confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.

068:010 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast
        prepared of thy goodness for the poor.

068:011 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that
        published it.

068:012 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home
        divided the spoil.

068:013 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the
        wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with
        yellow gold.

068:014 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow
        in Salmon.

068:015 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the
        hill of Bashan.

068:016 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God
        desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.

068:017 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
        angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy
        place.

068:018 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:
        thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious
        also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.

068:019 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even
        the God of our salvation. Selah.

068:020 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the
        Lord belong the issues from death.

068:021 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy
        scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.

068:022 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my
        people again from the depths of the sea:

068:023 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and
        the tongue of thy dogs in the same.

068:024 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God,
        my King, in the sanctuary.

068:025 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed
        after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.

068:026 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the
        fountain of Israel.

068:027 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of
        Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the
        princes of Naphtali.

068:028 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that
        which thou hast wrought for us.

068:029 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents
        unto thee.

068:030 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls,
        with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself
        with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in
        war.

068:031 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch
        out her hands unto God.

068:032 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto
        the Lord; Selah:

068:033 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of
        old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.

068:034 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel,
        and his strength is in the clouds.

068:035 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of
        Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.
        Blessed be God.

069:001 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.

069:002 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come
        into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

069:003 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail
        while I wait for my God.

069:004 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of
        mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies
        wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not
        away.

069:005 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid
        from thee.

069:006 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be
        ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be
        confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.

069:007 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered
        my face.

069:008 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
        mother's children.

069:009 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the
        reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

069:010 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to
        my reproach.

069:011 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
        them.

069:012 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song
        of the drunkards.

069:013 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an
        acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me,
        in the truth of thy salvation.

069:014 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be
        delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

069:015 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep
        swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

069:016 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
        according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.

069:017 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
        hear me speedily.

069:018 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of
        mine enemies.

069:019 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
        mine adversaries are all before thee.

069:020 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and
        I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for
        comforters, but I found none.

069:021 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
        me vinegar to drink.

069:022 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which
        should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.

069:023 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their
        loins continually to shake.

069:024 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful
        anger take hold of them.

069:025 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their
        tents.

069:026 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk
        to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

069:027 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into
        thy righteousness.

069:028 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be
        written with the righteous.

069:029 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me
        up on high.

069:030 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify
        him with thanksgiving.

069:031 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
        that hath horns and hoofs.

069:032 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall
        live that seek God.

069:033 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his
        prisoners.

069:034 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing
        that moveth therein.

069:035 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah:
        that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

069:036 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that
        love his name shall dwell therein.

070:001 MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O
        LORD.

070:002 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul:
        let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire
        my hurt.

070:003 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,
        Aha, aha.

070:004 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and
        let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be
        magnified.

070:005 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art
        my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.

071:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
        confusion.

071:002 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape:
        incline thine ear unto me, and save me.

071:003 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually
        resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art
        my rock and my fortress.

071:004 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of
        the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

071:005 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my
        youth.

071:006 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that
        took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be
        continually of thee.

071:007 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.

071:008 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
        the day.

071:009 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my
        strength faileth.

071:010 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for
        my soul take counsel together,

071:011 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for
        there is none to deliver him.

071:012 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

071:013 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
        soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that
        seek my hurt.

071:014 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and
        more.

071:015 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
        all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.

071:016 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention
        of thy righteousness, even of thine only.

071:017 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I
        declared thy wondrous works.

071:018 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
        until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy
        power to every one that is to come.

071:019 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done
        great things: O God, who is like unto thee!

071:020 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt
        quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths
        of the earth.

071:021 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every
        side.

071:022 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O
        my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One
        of Israel.

071:023 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
        soul, which thou hast redeemed.

071:024 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day
        long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto
        shame, that seek my hurt.

072:001 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto
        the king's son.

072:002 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor
        with judgment.

072:003 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
        hills, by righteousness.

072:004 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the
        children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the
        oppressor.

072:005 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
        throughout all generations.

072:006 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers
        that water the earth.

072:007 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of
        peace so long as the moon endureth.

072:008 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the
        river unto the ends of the earth.

072:009 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and
        his enemies shall lick the dust.

072:010 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:
        the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

072:011 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall
        serve him.

072:012 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,
        and him that hath no helper.

072:013 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of
        the needy.

072:014 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and
        precious shall their blood be in his sight.

072:015 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
        Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and
        daily shall he be praised.

072:016 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
        the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and
        they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

072:017 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as
        long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations
        shall call him blessed.

072:018 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth
        wondrous things.

072:019 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole
        earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.

072:020 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

073:001 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
        heart.

073:002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well
        nigh slipped.

073:003 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
        the wicked.

073:004 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is
        firm.

073:005 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued
        like other men.

073:006 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence
        covereth them as a garment.

073:007 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
        could wish.

073:008 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression:
        they speak loftily.

073:009 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
        walketh through the earth.

073:010 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup
        are wrung out to them.

073:011 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the
        most High?

073:012 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
        increase in riches.

073:013 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands
        in innocency.

073:014 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
        morning.

073:015 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against
        the generation of thy children.

073:016 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

073:017 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I
        their end.

073:018 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
        them down into destruction.

073:019 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
        utterly consumed with terrors.

073:020 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest,
        thou shalt despise their image.

073:021 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

073:022 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.

073:023 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me
        by my right hand.

073:024 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
        to glory.

073:025 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
        that I desire beside thee.

073:026 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
        heart, and my portion for ever.

073:027 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
        destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.

073:028 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust
        in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.

074:001 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine
        anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?

074:002 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old;
        the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this
        mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.

074:003 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
        the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

074:004 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set
        up their ensigns for signs.

074:005 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
        thick trees.

074:006 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with
        axes and hammers.

074:007 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
        casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.

074:008 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they
        have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

074:009 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is
        there among us any that knoweth how long.

074:010 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy
        blaspheme thy name for ever?

074:011 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it
        out of thy bosom.

074:012 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of
        the earth.

074:013 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the
        heads of the dragons in the waters.

074:014 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him
        to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

074:015 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up
        mighty rivers.

074:016 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared
        the light and the sun.

074:017 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made
        summer and winter.

074:018 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and
        that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.

074:019 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
        the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.

074:020 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the
        earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

074:021 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
        praise thy name.

074:022 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish
        man reproacheth thee daily.

074:023 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those
        that rise up against thee increaseth continually.

075:001 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give
        thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.

075:002 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.

075:003 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I
        bear up the pillars of it. Selah.

075:004 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,
        Lift not up the horn:

075:005 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.

075:006 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
        nor from the south.

075:007 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
        another.

075:008 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is
        red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same:
        but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring
        them out, and drink them.

075:009 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of
        Jacob.

075:010 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
        of the righteous shall be exalted.

076:001 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.

076:002 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in
        Zion.

076:003 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the
        sword, and the battle. Selah.

076:004 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of
        prey.

076:005 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and
        none of the men of might have found their hands.

076:006 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are
        cast into a dead sleep.

076:007 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy
        sight when once thou art angry?

076:008 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
        feared, and was still,

076:009 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
        Selah.

076:010 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of
        wrath shalt thou restrain.

076:011 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round
        about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

076:012 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the
        kings of the earth.

077:001 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice;
        and he gave ear unto me.

077:002 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the
        night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

077:003 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my
        spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.

077:004 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot
        speak.

077:005 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

077:006 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with
        mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

077:007 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no
        more?

077:008 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
        evermore?

077:009 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up
        his tender mercies? Selah.

077:010 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the
        years of the right hand of the most High.

077:011 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember
        thy wonders of old.

077:012 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

077:013 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as
        our God?

077:014 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy
        strength among the people.

077:015 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of
        Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

077:016 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were
        afraid: the depths also were troubled.

077:017 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine
        arrows also went abroad.

077:018 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings
        lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.

077:019 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and
        thy footsteps are not known.

077:020 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
        Aaron.

078:001 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the
        words of my mouth.

078:002 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings
        of old:

078:003 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

078:004 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the
        generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength,
        and his wonderful works that he hath done.

078:005 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law
        in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should
        make them known to their children:

078:006 That the generation to come might know them, even the children
        which should be born; who should arise and declare them to
        their children:

078:007 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the
        works of God, but keep his commandments:

078:008 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
        generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and
        whose spirit was not stedfast with God.

078:009 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows,
        turned back in the day of battle.

078:010 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
        law;

078:011 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.

078:012 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the
        land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

078:013 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he
        made the waters to stand as an heap.

078:014 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the
        night with a light of fire.

078:015 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as
        out of the great depths.

078:016 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to
        run down like rivers.

078:017 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most
        High in the wilderness.

078:018 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
        lust.

078:019 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a
        table in the wilderness?

078:020 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
        streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide
        flesh for his people?

078:021 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was
        kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

078:022 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
        salvation:

078:023 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
        doors of heaven,

078:024 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
        of the corn of heaven.

078:025 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.

078:026 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power
        he brought in the south wind.

078:027 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls
        like as the sand of the sea:

078:028 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about
        their habitations.

078:029 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their
        own desire;

078:030 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
        was yet in their mouths,

078:031 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
        and smote down the chosen men of Israel.

078:032 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
        wondrous works.

078:033 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
        in trouble.

078:034 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
        enquired early after God.

078:035 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
        their redeemer.

078:036 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
        lied unto him with their tongues.

078:037 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
        stedfast in his covenant.

078:038 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
        destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away,
        and did not stir up all his wrath.

078:039 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that
        passeth away, and cometh not again.

078:040 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
        in the desert!

078:041 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy
        One of Israel.

078:042 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered
        them from the enemy.

078:043 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
        field of Zoan.

078:044 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that
        they could not drink.

078:045 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
        and frogs, which destroyed them.

078:046 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
        labour unto the locust.

078:047 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
        with frost.

078:048 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to
        hot thunderbolts.

078:049 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
        indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.

078:050 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from
        death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;

078:051 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
        strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

078:052 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided
        them in the wilderness like a flock.

078:053 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the
        sea overwhelmed their enemies.

078:054 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to
        this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.

078:055 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
        inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in
        their tents.

078:056 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
        his testimonies:

078:057 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
        they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

078:058 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and
        moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

078:059 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred
        Israel:

078:060 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
        placed among men;

078:061 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into
        the enemy's hand.

078:062 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth
        with his inheritance.

078:063 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not
        given to marriage.

078:064 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
        lamentation.

078:065 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty
        man that shouteth by reason of wine.

078:066 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
        perpetual reproach.

078:067 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not
        the tribe of Ephraim:

078:068 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

078:069 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
        which he hath established for ever.

078:070 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
        sheepfolds:

078:071 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to
        feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

078:072 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
        guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

079:001 O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
        temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

079:002 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat
        unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the
        beasts of the earth.

079:003 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
        and there was none to bury them.

079:004 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and
        derision to them that are round about us.

079:005 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy
        jealousy burn like fire?

079:006 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee,
        and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.

079:007 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling
        place.

079:008 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender
        mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.

079:009 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name:
        and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.

079:010 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him
        be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of
        the blood of thy servants which is shed.

079:011 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to
        the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are
        appointed to die;

079:012 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom
        their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

079:013 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee
        thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all
        generations.

080:001 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like
        a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine
        forth.

080:002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
        and come and save us.

080:003 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we
        shall be saved.

080:004 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
        prayer of thy people?

080:005 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them
        tears to drink in great measure.

080:006 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
        laugh among themselves.

080:007 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine;
        and we shall be saved.

080:008 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
        heathen, and planted it.

080:009 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take
        deep root, and it filled the land.

080:010 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
        thereof were like the goodly cedars.

080:011 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto
        the river.

080:012 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
        which pass by the way do pluck her?

080:013 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of
        the field doth devour it.

080:014 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from
        heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;

080:015 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
        branch that thou madest strong for thyself.

080:016 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the
        rebuke of thy countenance.

080:017 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son
        of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

080:018 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call
        upon thy name.

080:019 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine;
        and we shall be saved.

081:001 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the
        God of Jacob.

081:002 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
        with the psaltery.

081:003 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on
        our solemn feast day.

081:004 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of
        Jacob.

081:005 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
        through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I
        understood not.

081:006 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were
        delivered from the pots.

081:007 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered
        thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the
        waters of Meribah. Selah.

081:008 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if
        thou wilt hearken unto me;

081:009 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou
        worship any strange god.

081:010 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
        Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

081:011 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would
        none of me.

081:012 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked
        in their own counsels.

081:013 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked
        in my ways!

081:014 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
        against their adversaries.

081:015 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
        him: but their time should have endured for ever.

081:016 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and
        with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.

082:001 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth
        among the gods.

082:002 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
        wicked? Selah.

082:003 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted
        and needy.

082:004 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the
        wicked.

082:005 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
        darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

082:006 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the
        most High.

082:007 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

082:008 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all
        nations.

083:001 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not
        still, O God.

083:002 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
        have lifted up the head.

083:003 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and
        consulted against thy hidden ones.

083:004 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
        nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

083:005 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
        confederate against thee:

083:006 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
        Hagarenes;

083:007 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
        inhabitants of Tyre;

083:008 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children
        of Lot. Selah.

083:009 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to
        Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

083:010 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.

083:011 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their
        princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

083:012 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
        possession.

083:013 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
        wind.

083:014 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
        mountains on fire;

083:015 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
        thy storm.

083:016 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
        LORD.

083:017 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be
        put to shame, and perish:

083:018 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art
        the most high over all the earth.

084:001 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

084:002 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the
        LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

084:003 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest
        for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O
        LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.

084:004 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still
        praising thee. Selah.

084:005 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart
        are the ways of them.

084:006 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the
        rain also filleth the pools.

084:007 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
        appeareth before God.

084:008 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.
        Selah.

084:009 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine
        anointed.

084:010 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had
        rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell
        in the tents of wickedness.

084:011 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace
        and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
        uprightly.

084:012 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

085:001 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast
        brought back the captivity of Jacob.

085:002 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast
        covered all their sin. Selah.

085:003 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself
        from the fierceness of thine anger.

085:004 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward
        us to cease.

085:005 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
        anger to all generations?

085:006 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
        thee?

085:007 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

085:008 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak
        peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not
        turn again to folly.

085:009 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory
        may dwell in our land.

085:010 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
        kissed each other.

085:011 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
        look down from heaven.

085:012 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land
        shall yield her increase.

085:013 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way
        of his steps.

086:001 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.

086:002 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy
        servant that trusteth in thee.

086:003 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.

086:004 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I
        lift up my soul.

086:005 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous
        in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

086:006 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of
        my supplications.

086:007 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt
        answer me.

086:008 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither
        are there any works like unto thy works.

086:009 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before
        thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.

086:010 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God
        alone.

086:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my
        heart to fear thy name.

086:012 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I
        will glorify thy name for evermore.

086:013 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my
        soul from the lowest hell.

086:014 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of
        violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee
        before them.

086:015 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
        longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.

086:016 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto
        thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.

086:017 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,
        and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and
        comforted me.

087:001 His foundation is in the holy mountains.

087:002 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings
        of Jacob.

087:003 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.

087:004 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:
        behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born
        there.

087:005 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in
        her: and the highest himself shall establish her.

087:006 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this
        man was born there. Selah.

087:007 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be
        there: all my springs are in thee.

088:001 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
        thee:

088:002 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;

088:003 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto
        the grave.

088:004 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a
        man that hath no strength:

088:005 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave,
        whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy
        hand.

088:006 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the
        deeps.

088:007 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with
        all thy waves. Selah.

088:008 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast
        made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot
        come forth.

088:009 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called
        daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.

088:010 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and
        praise thee? Selah.

088:011 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
        faithfulness in destruction?

088:012 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness
        in the land of forgetfulness?

088:013 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall
        my prayer prevent thee.

088:014 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
        from me?

088:015 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I
        suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

088:016 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.

088:017 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me
        about together.

088:018 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
        acquaintance into darkness.

089:001 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth
        will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.

089:002 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy
        faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

089:003 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David
        my servant,

089:004 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to
        all generations. Selah.

089:005 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy
        faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

089:006 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among
        the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?

089:007 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and
        to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.

089:008 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or
        to thy faithfulness round about thee?

089:009 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof
        arise, thou stillest them.

089:010 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
        hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.

089:011 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the
        world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.

089:012 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and
        Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.

089:013 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy
        right hand.

089:014 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy
        and truth shall go before thy face.

089:015 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall
        walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.

089:016 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy
        righteousness shall they be exalted.

089:017 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour
        our horn shall be exalted.

089:018 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our
        king.

089:019 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I
        have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one
        chosen out of the people.

089:020 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I
        anointed him:

089:021 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
        strengthen him.

089:022 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
        afflict him.

089:023 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them
        that hate him.

089:024 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my
        name shall his horn be exalted.

089:025 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the
        rivers.

089:026 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock
        of my salvation.

089:027 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of
        the earth.

089:028 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant
        shall stand fast with him.

089:029 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne
        as the days of heaven.

089:030 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

089:031 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

089:032 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
        iniquity with stripes.

089:033 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from
        him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

089:034 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
        out of my lips.

089:035 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto
        David.

089:036 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun
        before me.

089:037 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a
        faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

089:038 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with
        thine anointed.

089:039 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
        profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

089:040 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
        strong holds to ruin.

089:041 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
        neighbours.

089:042 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast
        made all his enemies to rejoice.

089:043 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made
        him to stand in the battle.

089:044 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to
        the ground.

089:045 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered
        him with shame. Selah.

089:046 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy
        wrath burn like fire?

089:047 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all
        men in vain?

089:048 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
        deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

089:049 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou
        swarest unto David in thy truth?

089:050 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in
        my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;

089:051 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith
        they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.

089:052 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

090:001 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

090:002 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
        formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to
        everlasting, thou art God.

090:003 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye
        children of men.

090:004 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it
        is past, and as a watch in the night.

090:005 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
        in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.

090:006 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening
        it is cut down, and withereth.

090:007 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
        troubled.

090:008 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in
        the light of thy countenance.

090:009 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our
        years as a tale that is told.

090:010 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by
        reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their
        strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly
        away.

090:011 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
        fear, so is thy wrath.

090:012 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
        unto wisdom.

090:013 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning
        thy servants.

090:014 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be
        glad all our days.

090:015 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
        us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.

090:016 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto
        their children.

090:017 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and
        establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of
        our hands establish thou it.

091:001 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall
        abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

091:002 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my
        God; in him will I trust.

091:003 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and
        from the noisome pestilence.

091:004 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings
        shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

091:005 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the
        arrow that flieth by day;

091:006 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
        destruction that wasteth at noonday.

091:007 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
        right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

091:008 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of
        the wicked.

091:009 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the
        most High, thy habitation;

091:010 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
        nigh thy dwelling.

091:011 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
        all thy ways.

091:012 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy
        foot against a stone.

091:013 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and
        the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

091:014 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
        him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

091:015 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with
        him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

091:016 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

092:001 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING
        PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:

092:002 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy
        faithfulness every night,

092:003 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon
        the harp with a solemn sound.

092:004 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will
        triumph in the works of thy hands.

092:005 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very
        deep.

092:006 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand
        this.

092:007 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers
        of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed
        for ever:

092:008 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.

092:009 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall
        perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

092:010 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I
        shall be anointed with fresh oil.

092:011 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine
        ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against
        me.

092:012 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow
        like a cedar in Lebanon.

092:013 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish
        in the courts of our God.

092:014 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be
        fat and flourishing;

092:015 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is
        no unrighteousness in him.

093:001 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is
        clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the
        world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.

093:002 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.

093:003 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up
        their voice; the floods lift up their waves.

093:004 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters,
        yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.

093:005 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house,
        O LORD, for ever.

094:001 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom
        vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.

094:002 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to
        the proud.

094:003 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
        triumph?

094:004 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the
        workers of iniquity boast themselves?

094:005 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine
        heritage.

094:006 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the
        fatherless.

094:007 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of
        Jacob regard it.

094:008 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when
        will ye be wise?

094:009 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the
        eye, shall he not see?

094:010 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that
        teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?

094:011 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

094:012 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest
        him out of thy law;

094:013 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
        until the pit be digged for the wicked.

094:014 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he
        forsake his inheritance.

094:015 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the
        upright in heart shall follow it.

094:016 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will
        stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

094:017 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
        silence.

094:018 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.

094:019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
        my soul.

094:020 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
        frameth mischief by a law?

094:021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the
        righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

094:022 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my
        refuge.

094:023 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut
        them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall
        cut them off.

095:001 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise
        to the rock of our salvation.

095:002 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a
        joyful noise unto him with psalms.

095:003 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

095:004 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of
        the hills is his also.

095:005 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
        land.

095:006 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the
        LORD our maker.

095:007 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and
        the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,

095:008 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the
        day of temptation in the wilderness:

095:009 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.

095:010 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,
        It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not
        known my ways:

095:011 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into
        my rest.

096:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the
        earth.

096:002 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation
        from day to day.

096:003 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all
        people.

096:004 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be
        feared above all gods.

096:005 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made
        the heavens.

096:006 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in
        his sanctuary.

096:007 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
        LORD glory and strength.

096:008 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
        offering, and come into his courts.

096:009 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,
        all the earth.

096:010 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also
        shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall
        judge the people righteously.

096:011 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the
        sea roar, and the fulness thereof.

096:012 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall
        all the trees of the wood rejoice

096:013 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
        earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the
        people with his truth.

097:001 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of
        isles be glad thereof.

097:002 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and
        judgment are the habitation of his throne.

097:003 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round
        about.

097:004 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and
        trembled.

097:005 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the
        presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

097:006 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see
        his glory.

097:007 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
        themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.

097:008 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
        because of thy judgments, O LORD.

097:009 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted
        far above all gods.

097:010 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of
        his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright
        in heart.

097:012 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the
        remembrance of his holiness.

098:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous
        things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the
        victory.

098:002 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath
        he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

098:003 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
        Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of
        our God.

098:004 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud
        noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

098:005 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice
        of a psalm.

098:006 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before
        the LORD, the King.

098:007 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
        that dwell therein.

098:008 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful
        together

098:009 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with
        righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with
        equity.

099:001 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between
        the cherubims; let the earth be moved.

099:002 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the
        people.

099:003 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.

099:004 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish
        equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

099:005 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for
        he is holy.

099:006 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that
        call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered
        them.

099:007 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his
        testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.

099:008 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that
        forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their
        inventions.

099:009 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the
        LORD our God is holy.

100:001 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.

100:002 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
        singing.

100:003 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us,
        and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his
        pasture.

100:004 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts
        with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

100:005 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
        endureth to all generations.

101:001 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I
        sing.

101:002 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou
        come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect
        heart.

101:003 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work
        of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

101:004 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
        person.

101:005 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off:
        him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I
        suffer.

101:006 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they
        may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall
        serve me.

101:007 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he
        that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.

101:008 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may
        cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

102:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.

102:002 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
        incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me
        speedily.

102:003 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned
        as an hearth.

102:004 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget
        to eat my bread.

102:005 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
        skin.

102:006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
        desert.

102:007 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

102:008 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
        against me are sworn against me.

102:009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
        weeping.

102:010 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast
        lifted me up, and cast me down.

102:011 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
        like grass.

102:012 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance
        unto all generations.

102:013 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to
        favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

102:014 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the
        dust thereof.

102:015 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the
        kings of the earth thy glory.

102:016 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
        glory.

102:017 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise
        their prayer.

102:018 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the
        people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

102:019 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
        heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

102:020 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
        appointed to death;

102:021 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
        Jerusalem;

102:022 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
        serve the LORD.

102:023 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

102:024 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:
        thy years are throughout all generations.

102:025 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the
        heavens are the work of thy hands.

102:026 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them
        shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change
        them, and they shall be changed:

102:027 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.

102:028 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
        shall be established before thee.

103:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless
        his holy name.

103:002 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

103:003 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
        diseases;

103:004 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee
        with lovingkindness and tender mercies;

103:005 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth
        is renewed like the eagle's.

103:006 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
        oppressed.

103:007 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children
        of Israel.

103:008 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and
        plenteous in mercy.

103:009 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
        ever.

103:010 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
        according to our iniquities.

103:011 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
        mercy toward them that fear him.

103:012 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed
        our transgressions from us.

103:013 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth
        them that fear him.

103:014 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

103:015 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field,
        so he flourisheth.

103:016 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place
        thereof shall know it no more.

103:017 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
        upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's
        children;

103:018 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
        commandments to do them.

103:019 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his
        kingdom ruleth over all.

103:020 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do
        his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

103:021 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that
        do his pleasure.

103:022 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:
        bless the LORD, O my soul.

104:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;
        thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

104:002 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
        stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

104:003 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh
        the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the
        wind:

104:004 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

104:005 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
        removed for ever.

104:006 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters
        stood above the mountains.

104:007 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they
        hasted away.

104:008 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
        the place which thou hast founded for them.

104:009 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
        turn not again to cover the earth.

104:010 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
        hills.

104:011 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
        quench their thirst.

104:012 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
        which sing among the branches.

104:013 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is
        satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

104:014 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
        service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

104:015 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make
        his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.

104:016 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
        which he hath planted;

104:017 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir
        trees are her house.

104:018 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
        for the conies.

104:019 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
        down.

104:020 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
        of the forest do creep forth.

104:021 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat
        from God.

104:022 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
        down in their dens.

104:023 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
        evening.

104:024 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
        them all: the earth is full of thy riches.

104:025 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
        innumerable, both small and great beasts.

104:026 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
        made to play therein.

104:027 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their
        meat in due season.

104:028 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
        they are filled with good.

104:029 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away
        their breath, they die, and return to their dust.

104:030 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
        renewest the face of the earth.

104:031 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall
        rejoice in his works.

104:032 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
        hills, and they smoke.

104:033 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing
        praise to my God while I have my being.

104:034 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
        LORD.

104:035 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
        wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye
        the LORD.

105:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known
        his deeds among the people.

105:002 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his
        wondrous works.

105:003 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
        seek the LORD.

105:004 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.

105:005 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
        and the judgments of his mouth;

105:006 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
        chosen.

105:007 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.

105:008 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
        commanded to a thousand generations.

105:009 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

105:010 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
        an everlasting covenant:

105:011 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
        your inheritance:

105:012 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
        strangers in it.

105:013 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
        another people;

105:014 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
        for their sakes;

105:015 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

105:016 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
        whole staff of bread.

105:017 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
        servant:

105:018 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

105:019 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried
        him.

105:020 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people,
        and let him go free.

105:021 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

105:022 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
        wisdom.

105:023 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land
        of Ham.

105:024 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
        than their enemies.

105:025 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly
        with his servants.

105:026 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.

105:027 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
        Ham.

105:028 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
        against his word.

105:029 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.

105:030 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers
        of their kings.

105:031 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in
        all their coasts.

105:032 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.

105:033 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
        trees of their coasts.

105:034 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
        without number,

105:035 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
        fruit of their ground.

105:036 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of
        all their strength.

105:037 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was
        not one feeble person among their tribes.

105:038 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
        upon them.

105:039 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in
        the night.

105:040 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
        with the bread of heaven.

105:041 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the
        dry places like a river.

105:042 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.

105:043 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
        gladness:

105:044 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
        labour of the people;

105:045 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws.
        Praise ye the LORD.

106:001 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is
        good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

106:002 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth
        all his praise?

106:003 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
        righteousness at all times.

106:004 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto
        thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;

106:005 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in
        the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine
        inheritance.

106:006 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity,
        we have done wickedly.

106:007 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they
        remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him
        at the sea, even at the Red sea.

106:008 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might
        make his mighty power to be known.

106:009 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led
        them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

106:010 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
        redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

106:011 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of
        them left.

106:012 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

106:013 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

106:014 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
        the desert.

106:015 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
        soul.

106:016 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
        LORD.

106:017 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
        company of Abiram.

106:018 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
        the wicked.

106:019 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

106:020 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox
        that eateth grass.

106:021 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
        Egypt;

106:022 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
        Red sea.

106:023 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses
        his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his
        wrath, lest he should destroy them.

106:024 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
        word:

106:025 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
        of the LORD.

106:026 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow
        them in the wilderness:

106:027 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
        them in the lands.

106:028 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
        sacrifices of the dead.

106:029 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the
        plague brake in upon them.

106:030 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
        plague was stayed.

106:031 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
        generations for evermore.

106:032 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went
        ill with Moses for their sakes:

106:033 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
        with his lips.

106:034 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
        commanded them:

106:035 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

106:036 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.

106:037 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
        devils,

106:038 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
        their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of
        Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.

106:039 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a
        whoring with their own inventions.

106:040 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his
        people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

106:041 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
        hated them ruled over them.

106:042 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
        subjection under their hand.

106:043 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
        their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

106:044 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
        cry:

106:045 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented
        according to the multitude of his mercies.

106:046 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
        captives.

106:047 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,
        to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy
        praise.

106:048 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
        everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the
        LORD.

107:001 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

107:002 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed
        from the hand of the enemy;

107:003 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from
        the west, from the north, and from the south.

107:004 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found
        no city to dwell in.

107:005 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

107:006 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he
        delivered them out of their distresses.

107:007 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to
        a city of habitation.

107:008 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
        his wonderful works to the children of men!

107:009 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry
        soul with goodness.

107:010 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being
        bound in affliction and iron;

107:011 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
        the counsel of the most High:

107:012 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
        down, and there was none to help.

107:013 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
        them out of their distresses.

107:014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
        brake their bands in sunder.

107:015 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
        his wonderful works to the children of men!

107:016 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of
        iron in sunder.

107:017 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
        iniquities, are afflicted.

107:018 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
        unto the gates of death.

107:019 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
        them out of their distresses.

107:020 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
        their destructions.

107:021 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
        his wonderful works to the children of men!

107:022 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
        declare his works with rejoicing.

107:023 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
        great waters;

107:024 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.

107:025 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
        up the waves thereof.

107:026 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
        their soul is melted because of trouble.

107:027 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
        at their wit's end.

107:028 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
        them out of their distresses.

107:029 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
        still.

107:030 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
        unto their desired haven.

107:031 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
        his wonderful works to the children of men!

107:032 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
        praise him in the assembly of the elders.

107:033 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into
        dry ground;

107:034 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
        that dwell therein.

107:035 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry
        ground into watersprings.

107:036 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
        a city for habitation;

107:037 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield
        fruits of increase.

107:038 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
        and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

107:039 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
        affliction, and sorrow.

107:040 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander
        in the wilderness, where there is no way.

107:041 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh
        him families like a flock.

107:042 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity
        shall stop her mouth.

107:043 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
        understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.

108:001 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even
        with my glory.

108:002 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

108:003 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing
        praises unto thee among the nations.

108:004 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth
        reacheth unto the clouds.

108:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
        all the earth;

108:006 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand,
        and answer me.

108:007 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
        Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

108:008 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength
        of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

108:009 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
        Philistia will I triumph.

108:010 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
        Edom?

108:011 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
        O God, go forth with our hosts?

108:012 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

108:013 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
        tread down our enemies.

109:001 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

109:002 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
        opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying
        tongue.

109:003 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
        against me without a cause.

109:004 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto
        prayer.

109:005 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my
        love.

109:006 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his
        right hand.

109:007 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his
        prayer become sin.

109:008 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.

109:009 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

109:010 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them
        seek their bread also out of their desolate places.

109:011 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
        strangers spoil his labour.

109:012 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there
        be any to favour his fatherless children.

109:013 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following
        let their name be blotted out.

109:014 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
        and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

109:015 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off
        the memory of them from the earth.

109:016 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
        the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in
        heart.

109:017 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted
        not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

109:018 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment,
        so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into
        his bones.

109:019 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for
        a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

109:020 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
        of them that speak evil against my soul.

109:021 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake:
        because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.

109:022 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

109:023 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up
        and down as the locust.

109:024 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of
        fatness.

109:025 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me
        they shaked their heads.

109:026 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:

109:027 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD,
        hast done it.

109:028 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
        ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

109:029 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
        themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.

109:030 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will
        praise him among the multitude.

109:031 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him
        from those that condemn his soul.

110:001 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
        make thine enemies thy footstool.

110:002 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule
        thou in the midst of thine enemies.

110:003 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
        beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast
        the dew of thy youth.

110:004 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest
        for ever after the order of Melchizedek.

110:005 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the
        day of his wrath.

110:006 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places
        with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many
        countries.

110:007 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he
        lift up the head.

111:001 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole
        heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the
        congregation.

111:002 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that
        have pleasure therein.

111:003 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness
        endureth for ever.

111:004 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
        gracious and full of compassion.

111:005 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be
        mindful of his covenant.

111:006 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may
        give them the heritage of the heathen.

111:007 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
        commandments are sure.

111:008 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
        uprightness.

111:009 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his
        covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.

111:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
        understanding have all they that do his commandments: his
        praise endureth for ever.

112:001 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
        that delighteth greatly in his commandments.

112:002 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the
        upright shall be blessed.

112:003 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness
        endureth for ever.

112:004 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is
        gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

112:005 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his
        affairs with discretion.

112:006 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be
        in everlasting remembrance.

112:007 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,
        trusting in the LORD.

112:008 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see
        his desire upon his enemies.

112:009 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his
        righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted
        with honour.

112:010 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with
        his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall
        perish.

113:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise
        the name of the LORD.

113:002 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for
        evermore.

113:003 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the
        LORD's name is to be praised.

113:004 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the
        heavens.

113:005 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

113:006 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven,
        and in the earth!

113:007 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy
        out of the dunghill;

113:008 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
        people.

113:009 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful
        mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.

114:001 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a
        people of strange language;

114:002 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.

114:003 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

114:004 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like
        lambs.

114:005 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,
        that thou wast driven back?

114:006 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,
        like lambs?

114:007 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
        presence of the God of Jacob;

114:008 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a
        fountain of waters.

115:001 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give
        glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

115:002 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?

115:003 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath
        pleased.

115:004 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

115:005 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they
        see not:

115:006 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they
        smell not:

115:007 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they
        walk not: neither speak they through their throat.

115:008 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
        trusteth in them.

115:009 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their
        shield.

115:010 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
        their shield.

115:011 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
        their shield.

115:012 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will
        bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.

115:013 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.

115:014 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your
        children.

115:015 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.

115:016 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth
        hath he given to the children of men.

115:017 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
        silence.

115:018 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for
        evermore. Praise the LORD.

116:001 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my
        supplications.

116:002 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I
        call upon him as long as I live.

116:003 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat
        hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.

116:004 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech
        thee, deliver my soul.

116:005 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.

116:006 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he
        helped me.

116:007 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt
        bountifully with thee.

116:008 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
        tears, and my feet from falling.

116:009 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

116:010 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

116:011 I said in my haste, All men are liars.

116:012 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
        me?

116:013 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of
        the LORD.

116:014 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all
        his people.

116:015 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.

116:016 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son
        of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.

116:017 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
        call upon the name of the LORD.

116:018 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all
        his people.

116:019 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O
        Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

117:001 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.

117:002 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of
        the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.

118:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy
        endureth for ever.

118:002 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

118:003 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for
        ever.

118:004 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth
        for ever.

118:005 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and
        set me in a large place.

118:006 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto
        me?

118:007 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore
        shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.

118:008 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
        man.

118:009 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
        princes.

118:010 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD
        will I destroy them.

118:011 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in
        the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

118:012 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the
        fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy
        them.

118:013 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD
        helped me.

118:014 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

118:015 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
        the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

118:016 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the
        LORD doeth valiantly.

118:017 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.

118:018 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over
        unto death.

118:019 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them,
        and I will praise the LORD:

118:020 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.

118:021 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
        salvation.

118:022 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
        of the corner.

118:023 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.

118:024 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and
        be glad in it.

118:025 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send
        now prosperity.

118:026 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have
        blessed you out of the house of the LORD.

118:027 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the
        sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.

118:028 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I
        will exalt thee.

118:029 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

119:001 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of
        the LORD.

119:002 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him
        with the whole heart.

119:003 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.

119:004 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.

119:005 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!

119:006 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
        commandments.

119:007 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall
        have learned thy righteous judgments.

119:008 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.

119:009 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
        thereto according to thy word.

119:010 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander
        from thy commandments.

119:011 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin
        against thee.

119:012 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.

119:013 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.

119:014 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in
        all riches.

119:015 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
        ways.

119:016 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy
        word.

119:017 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep
        thy word.

119:018 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
        thy law.

119:019 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from
        me.

119:020 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy
        judgments at all times.

119:021 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from
        thy commandments.

119:022 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
        testimonies.

119:023 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did
        meditate in thy statutes.

119:024 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.

119:025 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to
        thy word.

119:026 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy
        statutes.

119:027 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk
        of thy wondrous works.

119:028 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according
        unto thy word.

119:029 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law
        graciously.

119:030 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid
        before me.

119:031 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to
        shame.

119:032 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt
        enlarge my heart.

119:033 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it
        unto the end.

119:034 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
        observe it with my whole heart.

119:035 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do
        I delight.

119:036 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to
        covetousness.

119:037 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me
        in thy way.

119:038 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy
        fear.

119:039 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are
        good.

119:040 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
        righteousness.

119:041 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,
        according to thy word.

119:042 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:
        for I trust in thy word.

119:043 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I
        have hoped in thy judgments.

119:044 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.

119:045 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.

119:046 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will
        not be ashamed.

119:047 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have
        loved.

119:048 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I
        have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.

119:049 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast
        caused me to hope.

119:050 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
        quickened me.

119:051 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not
        declined from thy law.

119:052 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted
        myself.

119:053 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
        forsake thy law.

119:054 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.

119:055 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have
        kept thy law.

119:056 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.

119:057 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
        words.

119:058 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto
        me according to thy word.

119:059 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

119:060 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.

119:061 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not
        forgotten thy law.

119:062 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of
        thy righteous judgments.

119:063 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that
        keep thy precepts.

119:064 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy
        statutes.

119:065 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto
        thy word.

119:066 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy
        commandments.

119:067 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy
        word.

119:068 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.

119:069 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy
        precepts with my whole heart.

119:070 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.

119:071 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
        learn thy statutes.

119:072 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
        and silver.

119:073 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me
        understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.

119:074 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I
        have hoped in thy word.

119:075 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
        faithfulness hast afflicted me.

119:076 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
        according to thy word unto thy servant.

119:077 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy
        law is my delight.

119:078 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me
        without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.

119:079 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have
        known thy testimonies.

119:080 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.

119:081 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.

119:082 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort
        me?

119:083 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not
        forget thy statutes.

119:084 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute
        judgment on them that persecute me?

119:085 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy
        law.

119:086 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me
        wrongfully; help thou me.

119:087 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
        precepts.

119:088 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
        testimony of thy mouth.

119:089 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.

119:090 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast
        established the earth, and it abideth.

119:091 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all
        are thy servants.

119:092 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have
        perished in mine affliction.

119:093 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
        quickened me.

119:094 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.

119:095 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will
        consider thy testimonies.

119:096 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is
        exceeding broad.

119:097 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.

119:098 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
        enemies: for they are ever with me.

119:099 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy
        testimonies are my meditation.

119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy
        precepts.

119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
        keep thy word.

119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught
        me.

119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey
        to my mouth!

119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
        every false way.

119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
        righteous judgments.

119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto
        thy word.

119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
        LORD, and teach me thy judgments.

119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy
        law.

119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy
        precepts.

119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they
        are the rejoicing of my heart.

119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even
        unto the end.

119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.

119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.

119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments
        of my God.

119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me
        not be ashamed of my hope.

119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect
        unto thy statutes continually.

119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
        for their deceit is falsehood.

119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
        therefore I love thy testimonies.

119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
        judgments.

119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
        oppressors.

119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress
        me.

119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
        righteousness.

119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me
        thy statutes.

119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
        testimonies.

119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void
        thy law.

119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
        gold.

119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
        be right; and I hate every false way.

119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep
        them.

119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
        understanding unto the simple.

119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy
        commandments.

119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
        do unto those that love thy name.

119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have
        dominion over me.

119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy
        precepts.

119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
        statutes.

119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
        law.

119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.

119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and
        very faithful.

119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten
        thy words.

119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.

119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.

119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law
        is the truth.

119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy
        commandments are my delights.

119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me
        understanding, and I shall live.

119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy
        statutes.

119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.

119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in
        thy word.

119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in
        thy word.

119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD,
        quicken me according to thy judgment.

119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from
        thy law.

119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.

119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast
        founded them for ever.

119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget
        thy law.

119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy
        word.

119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy
        statutes.

119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to
        thy judgments.

119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline
        from thy testimonies.

119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept
        not thy word.

119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD,
        according to thy lovingkindness.

119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy
        righteous judgments endureth for ever.

119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart
        standeth in awe of thy word.

119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.

119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.

119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
        judgments.

119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall
        offend them.

119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy
        commandments.

119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them
        exceedingly.

119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways
        are before thee.

119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me
        understanding according to thy word.

119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to
        thy word.

119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy
        statutes.

119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments
        are righteousness.

119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.

119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my
        delight.

119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy
        judgments help me.

119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I
        do not forget thy commandments.

120:001 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.

120:002 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful
        tongue.

120:003 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto
        thee, thou false tongue?

120:004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

120:005 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
        of Kedar!

120:006 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.

120:007 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.

121:001 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
        help.

121:002 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.

121:003 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee
        will not slumber.

121:004 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor
        sleep.

121:005 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right
        hand.

121:006 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.

121:007 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve
        thy soul.

121:008 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from
        this time forth, and even for evermore.

122:001 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of
        the LORD.

122:002 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.

122:003 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:

122:004 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the
        testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.

122:005 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the
        house of David.

122:006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love
        thee.

122:007 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

122:008 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace
        be within thee.

122:009 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.

123:001 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
        heavens.

123:002 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
        masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
        mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that
        he have mercy upon us.

123:003 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
        exceedingly filled with contempt.

123:004 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
        are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.

124:001 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may
        Israel say;

124:002 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose
        up against us:

124:003 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
        kindled against us:

124:004 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over
        our soul:

124:005 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

124:006 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their
        teeth.

124:007 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
        the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

124:008 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and
        earth.

125:001 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which
        cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.

125:002 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is
        round about his people from henceforth even for ever.

125:003 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
        righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto
        iniquity.

125:004 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are
        upright in their hearts.

125:005 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD
        shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace
        shall be upon Israel.

126:001 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
        them that dream.

126:002 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
        singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done
        great things for them.

126:003 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.

126:004 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

126:005 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

126:006 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
        doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with
        him.

127:001 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that
        build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh
        but in vain.

127:002 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat
        the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

127:003 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the
        womb is his reward.

127:004 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of
        the youth.

127:005 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall
        not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the
        gate.

128:001 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in
        his ways.

128:002 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou
        be, and it shall be well with thee.

128:003 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
        house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.

128:004 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
        LORD.

128:005 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the
        good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

128:006 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon
        Israel.

129:001 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel
        now say:

129:002 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they
        have not prevailed against me.

129:003 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

129:004 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
        wicked.

129:005 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

129:006 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth
        afore it groweth up:

129:007 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth
        sheaves his bosom.

129:008 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be
        upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.

130:001 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.

130:002 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice
        of my supplications.

130:003 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
        stand?

130:004 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
        feared.

130:005 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
        hope.

130:006 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
        morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.

130:007 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy,
        and with him is plenteous redemption.

130:008 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

131:001 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do
        I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for
        me.

131:002 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
        weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

131:003 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.

132:001 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:

132:002 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of
        Jacob;

132:003 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go
        up into my bed;

132:004 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine
        eyelids,

132:005 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the
        mighty God of Jacob.

132:006 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of
        the wood.

132:007 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his
        footstool.

132:008 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy
        strength.

132:009 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy
        saints shout for joy.

132:010 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine
        anointed.

132:011 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from
        it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

132:012 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I
        shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy
        throne for evermore.

132:013 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his
        habitation.

132:014 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have
        desired it.

132:015 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor
        with bread.

132:016 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints
        shall shout aloud for joy.

132:017 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a
        lamp for mine anointed.

132:018 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall
        his crown flourish.

133:001 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
        together in unity!

133:002 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down
        upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the
        skirts of his garments;

133:003 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the
        mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing,
        even life for evermore.

134:001 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which
        by night stand in the house of the LORD.

134:002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.

134:003 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.

135:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise
        him, O ye servants of the LORD.

135:002 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the
        house of our God.

135:003 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his
        name; for it is pleasant.

135:004 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for
        his peculiar treasure.

135:005 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above
        all gods.

135:006 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in
        earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

135:007 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
        he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of
        his treasuries.

135:008 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

135:009 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
        upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

135:010 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

135:011 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the
        kingdoms of Canaan:

135:012 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel
        his people.

135:013 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD,
        throughout all generations.

135:014 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself
        concerning his servants.

135:015 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of
        men's hands.

135:016 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they
        see not;

135:017 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath
        in their mouths.

135:018 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that
        trusteth in them.

135:019 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of
        Aaron:

135:020 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless
        the LORD.

135:021 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.
        Praise ye the LORD.

136:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

136:002 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for
        ever.

136:003 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for
        ever.

136:004 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

136:005 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

136:006 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his
        mercy endureth for ever.

136:007 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for
        ever:

136:008 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

136:010 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy
        endureth for ever:

136:011 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth
        for ever:

136:012 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his
        mercy endureth for ever.

136:013 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy
        endureth for ever:

136:014 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy
        endureth for ever:

136:015 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his
        mercy endureth for ever.

136:016 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his
        mercy endureth for ever.

136:017 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for
        ever:

136:018 And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:019 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:020 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:021 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth
        for ever:

136:022 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

136:023 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth
        for ever:

136:024 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

136:025 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.

136:026 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

137:001 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept,
        when we remembered Zion.

137:002 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

137:003 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a
        song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying,
        Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

137:004 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?

137:005 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
        cunning.

137:006 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of
        my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

137:007 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of
        Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation
        thereof.

137:008 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he
        be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

137:009 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
        against the stones.

138:001 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I
        sing praise unto thee.

138:002 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for
        thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified
        thy word above all thy name.

138:003 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst
        me with strength in my soul.

138:004 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when
        they hear the words of thy mouth.

138:005 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the
        glory of the LORD.

138:006 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly:
        but the proud he knoweth afar off.

138:007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me:
        thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine
        enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.

138:008 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O
        LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own
        hands.

139:001 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.

139:002 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou
        understandest my thought afar off.

139:003 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
        with all my ways.

139:004 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou
        knowest it altogether.

139:005 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon
        me.

139:006 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
        attain unto it.

139:007 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee
        from thy presence?

139:008 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed
        in hell, behold, thou art there.

139:009 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
        parts of the sea;

139:010 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
        hold me.

139:011 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night
        shall be light about me.

139:012 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth
        as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

139:013 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my
        mother's womb.

139:014 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
        marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.

139:015 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret,
        and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

139:016 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
        thy book all my members were written, which in continuance
        were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

139:017 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great
        is the sum of them!

139:018 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
        when I awake, I am still with thee.

139:019 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me
        therefore, ye bloody men.

139:020 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take
        thy name in vain.

139:021 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I
        grieved with those that rise up against thee?

139:022 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.

139:023 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
        thoughts:

139:024 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
        way everlasting.

140:001 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the
        violent man;

140:002 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they
        gathered together for war.

140:003 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders'
        poison is under their lips. Selah.

140:004 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me
        from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my
        goings.

140:005 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread
        a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.

140:006 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my
        supplications, O LORD.

140:007 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast
        covered my head in the day of battle.

140:008 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his
        wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.

140:009 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the
        mischief of their own lips cover them.

140:010 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the
        fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

140:011 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil
        shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

140:012 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
        and the right of the poor.

140:013 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the
        upright shall dwell in thy presence.

141:001 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my
        voice, when I cry unto thee.

141:002 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the
        lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

141:003 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my
        lips.

141:004 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked
        works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their
        dainties.

141:005 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let
        him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not
        break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their
        calamities.

141:006 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall
        hear my words; for they are sweet.

141:007 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one
        cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.

141:008 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my
        trust; leave not my soul destitute.

141:009 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the
        gins of the workers of iniquity.

141:010 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal
        escape.

142:001 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the
        LORD did I make my supplication.

142:002 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my
        trouble.

142:003 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my
        path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a
        snare for me.

142:004 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man
        that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my
        soul.

142:005 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my
        portion in the land of the living.

142:006 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from
        my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

142:007 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the
        righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal
        bountifully with me.

143:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy
        faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.

143:002 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight
        shall no man living be justified.

143:003 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
        down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as
        those that have been long dead.

143:004 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within
        me is desolate.

143:005 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I
        muse on the work of thy hands.

143:006 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after
        thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.

143:007 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face
        from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

143:008 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in
        thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should
        walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.

143:009 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to
        hide me.

143:010 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is
        good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

143:011 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy
        righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.

143:012 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them
        that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.

144:001 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to
        war, and my fingers to fight:

144:002 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer;
        my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people
        under me.

144:003 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the
        son of man, that thou makest account of him!

144:004 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth
        away.

144:005 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains,
        and they shall smoke.

144:006 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine
        arrows, and destroy them.

144:007 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of
        great waters, from the hand of strange children;

144:008 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
        hand of falsehood.

144:009 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and
        an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

144:010 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth
        David his servant from the hurtful sword.

144:011 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children,
        whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
        hand of falsehood:

144:012 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that
        our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the
        similitude of a palace:

144:013 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store:
        that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in
        our streets:

144:014 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no
        breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in
        our streets.

144:015 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is
        that people, whose God is the LORD.

145:001 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name
        for ever and ever.

145:002 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for
        ever and ever.

145:003 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his
        greatness is unsearchable.

145:004 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall
        declare thy mighty acts.

145:005 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy
        wondrous works.

145:006 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I
        will declare thy greatness.

145:007 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
        and shall sing of thy righteousness.

145:008 The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger,
        and of great mercy.

145:009 The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all
        his works.

145:010 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall
        bless thee.

145:011 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy
        power;

145:012 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the
        glorious majesty of his kingdom.

145:013 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion
        endureth throughout all generations.

145:014 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those
        that be bowed down.

145:015 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their
        meat in due season.

145:016 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every
        living thing.

145:017 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his
        works.

145:018 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
        call upon him in truth.

145:019 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will
        hear their cry, and will save them.

145:020 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked
        will he destroy.

145:021 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh
        bless his holy name for ever and ever.

146:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.

146:002 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto
        my God while I have any being.

146:003 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom
        there is no help.

146:004 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
        very day his thoughts perish.

146:005 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose
        hope is in the LORD his God:

146:006 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein
        is: which keepeth truth for ever:

146:007 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food
        to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:

146:008 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them
        that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:

146:009 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless
        and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

146:010 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all
        generations. Praise ye the LORD.

147:001 Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our
        God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.

147:002 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the
        outcasts of Israel.

147:003 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

147:004 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by
        their names.

147:005 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is
        infinite.

147:006 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to
        the ground.

147:007 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the
        harp unto our God:

147:008 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for
        the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

147:009 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which
        cry.

147:010 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not
        pleasure in the legs of a man.

147:011 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that
        hope in his mercy.

147:012 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.

147:013 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath
        blessed thy children within thee.

147:014 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the
        finest of the wheat.

147:015 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth
        very swiftly.

147:016 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like
        ashes.

147:017 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before
        his cold?

147:018 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind
        to blow, and the waters flow.

147:019 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments
        unto Israel.

147:020 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his
        judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.

148:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens:
        praise him in the heights.

148:002 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.

148:003 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of
        light.

148:004 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above
        the heavens.

148:005 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and
        they were created.

148:006 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a
        decree which shall not pass.

148:007 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:

148:008 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his
        word:

148:009 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:

148:010 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:

148:011 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of
        the earth:

148:012 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:

148:013 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is
        excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.

148:014 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his
        saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto
        him. Praise ye the LORD.

149:001 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his
        praise in the congregation of saints.

149:002 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of
        Zion be joyful in their King.

149:003 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises
        unto him with the timbrel and harp.

149:004 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify
        the meek with salvation.

149:005 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon
        their beds.

149:006 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged
        sword in their hand;

149:007 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon
        the people;

149:008 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters
        of iron;

149:009 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have
        all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.

150:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in
        the firmament of his power.

150:002 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his
        excellent greatness.

150:003 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the
        psaltery and harp.

150:004 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with
        stringed instruments and organs.

150:005 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high
        sounding cymbals.

150:006 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye
        the LORD.

Book 20	Proverbs

001:001 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

001:002 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of
        understanding;

001:003 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment,
        and equity;

001:004 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and
        discretion.

001:005 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
        understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:

001:006 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of
        the wise, and their dark sayings.

001:007 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools
        despise wisdom and instruction.

001:008 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not
        the law of thy mother:

001:009 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and
        chains about thy neck.

001:010 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

001:011 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us
        lurk privily for the innocent without cause:

001:012 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those
        that go down into the pit:

001:013 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses
        with spoil:

001:014 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:

001:015 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot
        from their path:

001:016 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.

001:017 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

001:018 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for
        their own lives.

001:019 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which
        taketh away the life of the owners thereof.

001:020 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:

001:021 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of
        the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,

001:022 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the
        scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?

001:023 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto
        you, I will make known my words unto you.

001:024 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my
        hand, and no man regarded;

001:025 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my
        reproof:

001:026 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear
        cometh;

001:027 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction
        cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon
        you.

001:028 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they
        shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:

001:029 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of
        the LORD:

001:030 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.

001:031 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be
        filled with their own devices.

001:032 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
        prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

001:033 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be
        quiet from fear of evil.

002:001 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my
        commandments with thee;

002:002 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine
        heart to understanding;

002:003 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice
        for understanding;

002:004 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for
        hid treasures;

002:005 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the
        knowledge of God.

002:006 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge
        and understanding.

002:007 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler
        to them that walk uprightly.

002:008 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of
        his saints.

002:009 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
        equity; yea, every good path.

002:010 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is
        pleasant unto thy soul;

002:011 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:

002:012 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man
        that speaketh froward things;

002:013 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of
        darkness;

002:014 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the
        wicked;

002:015 Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:

002:016 To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger
        which flattereth with her words;

002:017 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the
        covenant of her God.

002:018 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the
        dead.

002:019 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of
        the paths of life.

002:020 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the
        paths of the righteous.

002:021 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall
        remain in it.

002:022 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the
        transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

003:001 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my
        commandments:

003:002 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add
        to thee.

003:003 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy
        neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:

003:004 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight
        of God and man.

003:005 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto
        thine own understanding.

003:006 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
        paths.

003:007 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from
        evil.

003:008 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

003:009 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits
        of all thine increase:

003:010 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses
        shall burst out with new wine.

003:011 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be
        weary of his correction:

003:012 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the
        son in whom he delighteth.

003:013 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
        understanding.

003:014 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of
        silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

003:015 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou
        canst desire are not to be compared unto her.

003:016 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand
        riches and honour.

003:017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are
        peace.

003:018 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and
        happy is every one that retaineth her.

003:019 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding
        hath he established the heavens.

003:020 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop
        down the dew.

003:021 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom
        and discretion:

003:022 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

003:023 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not
        stumble.

003:024 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou
        shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

003:025 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the
        wicked, when it cometh.

003:026 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot
        from being taken.

003:027 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in
        the power of thine hand to do it.

003:028 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow
        I will give; when thou hast it by thee.

003:029 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth
        securely by thee.

003:030 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no
        harm.

003:031 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

003:032 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is
        with the righteous.

003:033 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he
        blesseth the habitation of the just.

003:034 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the
        lowly.

003:035 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion
        of fools.

004:001 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to
        know understanding.

004:002 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

004:003 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the
        sight of my mother.

004:004 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my
        words: keep my commandments, and live.

004:005 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline
        from the words of my mouth.

004:006 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and
        she shall keep thee.

004:007 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with
        all thy getting get understanding.

004:008 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to
        honour, when thou dost embrace her.

004:009 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of
        glory shall she deliver to thee.

004:010 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy
        life shall be many.

004:011 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in
        right paths.

004:012 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when
        thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

004:013 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for
        she is thy life.

004:014 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way
        of evil men.

004:015 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.

004:016 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their
        sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

004:017 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of
        violence.

004:018 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth
        more and more unto the perfect day.

004:019 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what
        they stumble.

004:020 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.

004:021 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of
        thine heart.

004:022 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all
        their flesh.

004:023 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the
        issues of life.

004:024 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far
        from thee.

004:025 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look
        straight before thee.

004:026 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be
        established.

004:027 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot
        from evil.

005:001 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my
        understanding:

005:002 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep
        knowledge.

005:003 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her
        mouth is smoother than oil:

005:004 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.

005:005 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

005:006 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are
        moveable, that thou canst not know them.

005:007 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the
        words of my mouth.

005:008 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her
        house:

005:009 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto
        the cruel:

005:010 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be
        in the house of a stranger;

005:011 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are
        consumed,

005:012 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised
        reproof;

005:013 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined
        mine ear to them that instructed me!

005:014 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and
        assembly.

005:015 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out
        of thine own well.

005:016 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in
        the streets.

005:017 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

005:018 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy
        youth.

005:019 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her
        breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always
        with her love.

005:020 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
        and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

005:021 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he
        pondereth all his goings.

005:022 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall
        be holden with the cords of his sins.

005:023 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his
        folly he shall go astray.

006:001 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast
        stricken thy hand with a stranger,

006:002 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken
        with the words of thy mouth.

006:003 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come
        into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure
        thy friend.

006:004 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

006:005 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a
        bird from the hand of the fowler.

006:006 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

006:007 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,

006:008 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in
        the harvest.

006:009 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out
        of thy sleep?

006:010 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
        hands to sleep:

006:011 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want
        as an armed man.

006:012 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

006:013 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he
        teacheth with his fingers;

006:014 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually;
        he soweth discord.

006:015 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he
        be broken without remedy.

006:016 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an
        abomination unto him:

006:017 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent
        blood,

006:018 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift
        in running to mischief,

006:019 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord
        among brethren.

006:020 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law
        of thy mother:

006:021 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy
        neck.

006:022 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it
        shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with
        thee.

006:023 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and
        reproofs of instruction are the way of life:

006:024 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the
        tongue of a strange woman.

006:025 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take
        thee with her eyelids.

006:026 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of
        bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.

006:027 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be
        burned?

006:028 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

006:029 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever
        toucheth her shall not be innocent.

006:030 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul
        when he is hungry;

006:031 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give
        all the substance of his house.

006:032 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh
        understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

006:033 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not
        be wiped away.

006:034 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare
        in the day of vengeance.

006:035 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,
        though thou givest many gifts.

007:001 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

007:002 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of
        thine eye.

007:003 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine
        heart.

007:004 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding
        thy kinswoman:

007:005 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the
        stranger which flattereth with her words.

007:006 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

007:007 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the
        youths, a young man void of understanding,

007:008 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the
        way to her house,

007:009 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

007:010 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an
        harlot, and subtil of heart.

007:011 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

007:012 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at
        every corner.)

007:013 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face
        said unto him,

007:014 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

007:015 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy
        face, and I have found thee.

007:016 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
        works, with fine linen of Egypt.

007:017 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

007:018 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us
        solace ourselves with loves.

007:019 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:

007:020 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at
        the day appointed.

007:021 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the
        flattering of her lips she forced him.

007:022 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the
        slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;

007:023 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the
        snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.

007:024 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to
        the words of my mouth.

007:025 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her
        paths.

007:026 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have
        been slain by her.

007:027 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
        death.

008:001 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

008:002 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the
        places of the paths.

008:003 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the
        coming in at the doors.

008:004 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.

008:005 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an
        understanding heart.

008:006 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of
        my lips shall be right things.

008:007 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an
        abomination to my lips.

008:008 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is
        nothing froward or perverse in them.

008:009 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to
        them that find knowledge.

008:010 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather
        than choice gold.

008:011 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may
        be desired are not to be compared to it.

008:012 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty
        inventions.

008:013 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy,
        and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

008:014 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have
        strength.

008:015 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

008:016 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the
        earth.

008:017 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall
        find me.

008:018 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and
        righteousness.

008:019 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my
        revenue than choice silver.

008:020 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths
        of judgment:

008:021 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and
        I will fill their treasures.

008:022 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his
        works of old.

008:023 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the
        earth was.

008:024 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there
        were no fountains abounding with water.

008:025 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I
        brought forth:

008:026 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor
        the highest part of the dust of the world.

008:027 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a
        compass upon the face of the depth:

008:028 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the
        fountains of the deep:

008:029 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not
        pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the
        earth:

008:030 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily
        his delight, rejoicing always before him;

008:031 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights
        were with the sons of men.

008:032 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are
        they that keep my ways.

008:033 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.

008:034 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my
        gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

008:035 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of
        the LORD.

008:036 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they
        that hate me love death.

009:001 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven
        pillars:

009:002 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she
        hath also furnished her table.

009:003 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest
        places of the city,

009:004 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that
        wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

009:005 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have
        mingled.

009:006 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of
        understanding.

009:007 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he
        that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.

009:008 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man,
        and he will love thee.

009:009 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:
        teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.

009:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the
        knowledge of the holy is understanding.

009:011 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy
        life shall be increased.

009:012 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou
        scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.

009:013 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth
        nothing.

009:014 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the
        high places of the city,

009:015 To call passengers who go right on their ways:

009:016 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that
        wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

009:017 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is
        pleasant.

009:018 But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her
        guests are in the depths of hell.

010:001 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but
        a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

010:002 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness
        delivereth from death.

010:003 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish:
        but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.

010:004 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand
        of the diligent maketh rich.

010:005 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that
        sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.

010:006 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth
        the mouth of the wicked.

010:007 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked
        shall rot.

010:008 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating
        fool shall fall.

010:009 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that
        perverteth his ways shall be known.

010:010 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating
        fool shall fall.

010:011 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence
        covereth the mouth of the wicked.

010:012 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.

010:013 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:
        but a rod is for the back of him that is void of
        understanding.

010:014 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is
        near destruction.

010:015 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of
        the poor is their poverty.

010:016 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the
        wicked to sin.

010:017 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that
        refuseth reproof erreth.

010:018 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a
        slander, is a fool.

010:019 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that
        refraineth his lips is wise.

010:020 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the
        wicked is little worth.

010:021 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of
        wisdom.

010:022 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no
        sorrow with it.

010:023 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of
        understanding hath wisdom.

010:024 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire
        of the righteous shall be granted.

010:025 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the
        righteous is an everlasting foundation.

010:026 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the
        sluggard to them that send him.

010:027 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the
        wicked shall be shortened.

010:028 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the
        expectation of the wicked shall perish.

010:029 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but
        destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.

010:030 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not
        inhabit the earth.

010:031 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward
        tongue shall be cut out.

010:032 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the
        mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.

011:001 A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight
        is his delight.

011:002 When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is
        wisdom.

011:003 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the
        perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.

011:004 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness
        delivereth from death.

011:005 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the
        wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

011:006 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but
        transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.

011:007 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the
        hope of unjust men perisheth.

011:008 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked
        cometh in his stead.

011:009 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but
        through knowledge shall the just be delivered.

011:010 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and
        when the wicked perish, there is shouting.

011:011 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is
        overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

011:012 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man
        of understanding holdeth his peace.

011:013 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful
        spirit concealeth the matter.

011:014 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of
        counsellors there is safety.

011:015 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he
        that hateth suretiship is sure.

011:016 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain
        riches.

011:017 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is
        cruel troubleth his own flesh.

011:018 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth
        righteousness shall be a sure reward.

011:019 As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil
        pursueth it to his own death.

011:020 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD:
        but such as are upright in their way are his delight.

011:021 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished:
        but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

011:022 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman
        which is without discretion.

011:023 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation
        of the wicked is wrath.

011:024 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is
        that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.

011:025 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall
        be watered also himself.

011:026 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but
        blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.

011:027 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that
        seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.

011:028 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous
        shall flourish as a branch.

011:029 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and
        the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.

011:030 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that
        winneth souls is wise.

011:031 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much
        more the wicked and the sinner.

012:001 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth
        reproof is brutish.

012:002 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked
        devices will he condemn.

012:003 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of
        the righteous shall not be moved.

012:004 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that
        maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.

012:005 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of
        the wicked are deceit.

012:006 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the
        mouth of the upright shall deliver them.

012:007 The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the
        righteous shall stand.

012:008 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that
        is of a perverse heart shall be despised.

012:009 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he
        that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.

012:010 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the
        tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.

012:011 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he
        that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.

012:012 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the
        righteous yieldeth fruit.

012:013 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the
        just shall come out of trouble.

012:014 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth:
        and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto
        him.

012:015 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that
        hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.

012:016 A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth
        shame.

012:017 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a
        false witness deceit.

012:018 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the
        tongue of the wise is health.

012:019 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying
        tongue is but for a moment.

012:020 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the
        counsellors of peace is joy.

012:021 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall
        be filled with mischief.

012:022 Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal
        truly are his delight.

012:023 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools
        proclaimeth foolishness.

012:024 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful
        shall be under tribute.

012:025 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word
        maketh it glad.

012:026 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the
        way of the wicked seduceth them.

012:027 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting:
        but the substance of a diligent man is precious.

012:028 In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway
        thereof there is no death.

013:001 A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner
        heareth not rebuke.

013:002 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul
        of the transgressors shall eat violence.

013:003 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that
        openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.

013:004 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the
        soul of the diligent shall be made fat.

013:005 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome,
        and cometh to shame.

013:006 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but
        wickedness overthroweth the sinner.

013:007 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is
        that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.

013:008 The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor
        heareth not rebuke.

013:009 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the
        wicked shall be put out.

013:010 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is
        wisdom.

013:011 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that
        gathereth by labour shall increase.

013:012 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire
        cometh, it is a tree of life.

013:013 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that
        feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.

013:014 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the
        snares of death.

013:015 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors
        is hard.

013:016 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth
        open his folly.

013:017 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful
        ambassador is health.

013:018 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction:
        but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.

013:019 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is
        abomination to fools to depart from evil.

013:020 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion
        of fools shall be destroyed.

013:021 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be
        repayed.

013:022 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children:
        and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.

013:023 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is
        destroyed for want of judgment.

013:024 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him
        chasteneth him betimes.

013:025 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the
        belly of the wicked shall want.

014:001 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh
        it down with her hands.

014:002 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he
        that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.

014:003 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of
        the wise shall preserve them.

014:004 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by
        the strength of the ox.

014:005 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will
        utter lies.

014:006 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is
        easy unto him that understandeth.

014:007 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest
        not in him the lips of knowledge.

014:008 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the
        folly of fools is deceit.

014:009 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is
        favour.

014:010 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not
        intermeddle with his joy.

014:011 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the
        tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.

014:012 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end
        thereof are the ways of death.

014:013 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that
        mirth is heaviness.

014:014 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and
        a good man shall be satisfied from himself.

014:015 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh
        well to his going.

014:016 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool
        rageth, and is confident.

014:017 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked
        devices is hated.

014:018 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with
        knowledge.

014:019 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of
        the righteous.

014:020 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath
        many friends.

014:021 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath
        mercy on the poor, happy is he.

014:022 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be
        to them that devise good.

014:023 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips
        tendeth only to penury.

014:024 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of
        fools is folly.

014:025 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness
        speaketh lies.

014:026 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children
        shall have a place of refuge.

014:027 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the
        snares of death.

014:028 In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the
        want of people is the destruction of the prince.

014:029 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he
        that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

014:030 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the
        rottenness of the bones.

014:031 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that
        honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.

014:032 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous
        hath hope in his death.

014:033 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding:
        but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.

014:034 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any
        people.

014:035 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is
        against him that causeth shame.

015:001 A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up
        anger.

015:002 The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth
        of fools poureth out foolishness.

015:003 The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil
        and the good.

015:004 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein
        is a breach in the spirit.

015:005 A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that
        regardeth reproof is prudent.

015:006 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the
        revenues of the wicked is trouble.

015:007 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the
        foolish doeth not so.

015:008 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but
        the prayer of the upright is his delight.

015:009 The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he
        loveth him that followeth after righteousness.

015:010 Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he
        that hateth reproof shall die.

015:011 Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then
        the hearts of the children of men?

015:012 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he
        go unto the wise.

015:013 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of
        the heart the spirit is broken.

015:014 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:
        but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.

015:015 All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a
        merry heart hath a continual feast.

015:016 Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure
        and trouble therewith.

015:017 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox
        and hatred therewith.

015:018 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to
        anger appeaseth strife.

015:019 The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the
        way of the righteous is made plain.

015:020 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth
        his mother.

015:021 Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of
        understanding walketh uprightly.

015:022 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the
        multitude of counsellors they are established.

015:023 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken
        in due season, how good is it!

015:024 The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from
        hell beneath.

015:025 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will
        establish the border of the widow.

015:026 The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but
        the words of the pure are pleasant words.

015:027 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that
        hateth gifts shall live.

015:028 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth
        of the wicked poureth out evil things.

015:029 The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of
        the righteous.

015:030 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report
        maketh the bones fat.

015:031 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the
        wise.

015:032 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he
        that heareth reproof getteth understanding.

015:033 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before
        honour is humility.

016:001 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the
        tongue, is from the LORD.

016:002 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD
        weigheth the spirits.

016:003 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be
        established.

016:004 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the
        wicked for the day of evil.

016:005 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the
        LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

016:006 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the
        LORD men depart from evil.

016:007 When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies
        to be at peace with him.

016:008 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues
        without right.

016:009 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his
        steps.

016:010 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth
        transgresseth not in judgment.

016:011 A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of
        the bag are his work.

016:012 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the
        throne is established by righteousness.

016:013 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him
        that speaketh right.

016:014 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man
        will pacify it.

016:015 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour
        is as a cloud of the latter rain.

016:016 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get
        understanding rather to be chosen than silver!

016:017 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that
        keepeth his way preserveth his soul.

016:018 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a
        fall.

016:019 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to
        divide the spoil with the proud.

016:020 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso
        trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.

016:021 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness
        of the lips increaseth learning.

016:022 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it:
        but the instruction of fools is folly.

016:023 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning
        to his lips.

016:024 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and
        health to the bones.

016:025 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end
        thereof are the ways of death.

016:026 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth
        it of him.

016:027 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a
        burning fire.

016:028 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief
        friends.

016:029 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the
        way that is not good.

016:030 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips
        he bringeth evil to pass.

016:031 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way
        of righteousness.

016:032 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he
        that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

016:033 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof
        is of the LORD.

017:001 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house
        full of sacrifices with strife.

017:002 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,
        and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.

017:003 The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but
        the LORD trieth the hearts.

017:004 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear
        to a naughty tongue.

017:005 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is
        glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.

017:006 Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of
        children are their fathers.

017:007 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips
        a prince.

017:008 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
        whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

017:009 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that
        repeateth a matter separateth very friends.

017:010 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred
        stripes into a fool.

017:011 An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel
        messenger shall be sent against him.

017:012 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool
        in his folly.

017:013 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his
        house.

017:014 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:
        therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.

017:015 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the
        just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.

017:016 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get
        wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?

017:017 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for
        adversity.

017:018 A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh
        surety in the presence of his friend.

017:019 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that
        exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.

017:020 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath
        a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.

017:021 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the
        father of a fool hath no joy.

017:022 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit
        drieth the bones.

017:023 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the
        ways of judgment.

017:024 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of
        a fool are in the ends of the earth.

017:025 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her
        that bare him.

017:026 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for
        equity.

017:027 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of
        understanding is of an excellent spirit.

017:028 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and
        he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.

018:001 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and
        intermeddleth with all wisdom.

018:002 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart
        may discover itself.

018:003 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with
        ignominy reproach.

018:004 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the
        wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.

018:005 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to
        overthrow the righteous in judgment.

018:006 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for
        strokes.

018:007 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare
        of his soul.

018:008 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
        the innermost parts of the belly.

018:009 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is
        a great waster.

018:010 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth
        into it, and is safe.

018:011 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall
        in his own conceit.

018:012 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before
        honour is humility.

018:013 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly
        and shame unto him.

018:014 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded
        spirit who can bear?

018:015 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the
        wise seeketh knowledge.

018:016 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before
        great men.

018:017 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his
        neighbour cometh and searcheth him.

018:018 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the
        mighty.

018:019 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and
        their contentions are like the bars of a castle.

018:020 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;
        and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.

018:021 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that
        love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

018:022 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth
        favour of the LORD.

018:023 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.

018:024 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there
        is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.

019:001 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that
        is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.

019:002 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and
        he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.

019:003 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart
        fretteth against the LORD.

019:004 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his
        neighbour.

019:005 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh
        lies shall not escape.

019:006 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a
        friend to him that giveth gifts.

019:007 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his
        friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they
        are wanting to him.

019:008 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth
        understanding shall find good.

019:009 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh
        lies shall perish.

019:010 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to
        have rule over princes.

019:011 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his
        glory to pass over a transgression.

019:012 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour
        is as dew upon the grass.

019:013 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the
        contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.

019:014 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent
        wife is from the LORD.

019:015 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall
        suffer hunger.

019:016 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he
        that despiseth his ways shall die.

019:017 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and
        that which he hath given will he pay him again.

019:018 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul
        spare for his crying.

019:019 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou
        deliver him, yet thou must do it again.

019:020 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be
        wise in thy latter end.

019:021 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the
        counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.

019:022 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better
        than a liar.

019:023 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it
        shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.

019:024 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so
        much as bring it to his mouth again.

019:025 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one
        that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.

019:026 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a
        son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.

019:027 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err
        from the words of knowledge.

019:028 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the
        wicked devoureth iniquity.

019:029 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back
        of fools.

020:001 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is
        deceived thereby is not wise.

020:002 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso
        provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.

020:003 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool
        will be meddling.

020:004 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore
        shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.

020:005 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of
        understanding will draw it out.

020:006 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a
        faithful man who can find?

020:007 The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are
        blessed after him.

020:008 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away
        all evil with his eyes.

020:009 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my
        sin?

020:010 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike
        abomination to the LORD.

020:011 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure,
        and whether it be right.

020:012 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even
        both of them.

020:013 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes,
        and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.

020:014 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is
        gone his way, then he boasteth.

020:015 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of
        knowledge are a precious jewel.

020:016 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a
        pledge of him for a strange woman.

020:017 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth
        shall be filled with gravel.

020:018 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice
        make war.

020:019 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets:
        therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.

020:020 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put
        out in obscure darkness.

020:021 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the
        end thereof shall not be blessed.

020:022 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD,
        and he shall save thee.

020:023 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false
        balance is not good.

020:024 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand
        his own way?

020:025 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and
        after vows to make enquiry.

020:026 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over
        them.

020:027 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the
        inward parts of the belly.

020:028 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden
        by mercy.

020:029 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of
        old men is the grey head.

020:030 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the
        inward parts of the belly.

021:001 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of
        water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

021:002 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD
        pondereth the hearts.

021:003 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than
        sacrifice.

021:004 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the
        wicked, is sin.

021:005 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but
        of every one that is hasty only to want.

021:006 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed
        to and fro of them that seek death.

021:007 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they
        refuse to do judgment.

021:008 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure,
        his work is right.

021:009 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a
        brawling woman in a wide house.

021:010 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no
        favour in his eyes.

021:011 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and
        when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

021:012 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked:
        but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.

021:013 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall
        cry himself, but shall not be heard.

021:014 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom
        strong wrath.

021:015 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be
        to the workers of iniquity.

021:016 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall
        remain in the congregation of the dead.

021:017 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth
        wine and oil shall not be rich.

021:018 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the
        transgressor for the upright.

021:019 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a
        contentious and an angry woman.

021:020 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the
        wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

021:021 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life,
        righteousness, and honour.

021:022 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down
        the strength of the confidence thereof.

021:023 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
        troubles.

021:024 Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud
        wrath.

021:025 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse
        to labour.

021:026 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous
        giveth and spareth not.

021:027 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more,
        when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?

021:028 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth
        speaketh constantly.

021:029 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he
        directeth his way.

021:030 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the
        LORD.

021:031 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is
        of the LORD.

022:001 A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and
        loving favour rather than silver and gold.

022:002 The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them
        all.

022:003 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the
        simple pass on, and are punished.

022:004 By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour,
        and life.

022:005 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth
        keep his soul shall be far from them.

022:006 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old,
        he will not depart from it.

022:007 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to
        the lender.

022:008 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his
        anger shall fail.

022:009 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth
        of his bread to the poor.

022:010 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife
        and reproach shall cease.

022:011 He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips
        the king shall be his friend.

022:012 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth
        the words of the transgressor.

022:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be
        slain in the streets.

022:014 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred
        of the LORD shall fall therein.

022:015 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of
        correction shall drive it far from him.

022:016 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he
        that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.

022:017 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply
        thine heart unto my knowledge.

022:018 For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they
        shall withal be fitted in thy lips.

022:019 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee
        this day, even to thee.

022:020 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and
        knowledge,

022:021 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of
        truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them
        that send unto thee?

022:022 Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the
        afflicted in the gate:

022:023 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of
        those that spoiled them.

022:024 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man
        thou shalt not go:

022:025 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.

022:026 Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are
        sureties for debts.

022:027 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed
        from under thee?

022:028 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.

022:029 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand
        before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.

023:001 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently
        what is before thee:

023:002 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to
        appetite.

023:003 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.

023:004 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.

023:005 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches
        certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle
        toward heaven.

023:006 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither
        desire thou his dainty meats:

023:007 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink,
        saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.

023:008 The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose
        thy sweet words.

023:009 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the
        wisdom of thy words.

023:010 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of
        the fatherless:

023:011 For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with
        thee.

023:012 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the
        words of knowledge.

023:013 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest
        him with the rod, he shall not die.

023:014 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul
        from hell.

023:015 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even
        mine.

023:016 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.

023:017 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of
        the LORD all the day long.

023:018 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be
        cut off.

023:019 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the
        way.

023:020 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

023:021 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and
        drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.

023:022 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy
        mother when she is old.

023:023 Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction,
        and understanding.

023:024 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that
        begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.

023:025 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare
        thee shall rejoice.

023:026 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my
        ways.

023:027 For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow
        pit.

023:028 She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the
        transgressors among men.

023:029 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath
        babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of
        eyes?

023:030 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed
        wine.

023:031 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his
        colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

023:032 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an
        adder.

023:033 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall
        utter perverse things.

023:034 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the
        sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

023:035 They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick;
        they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I
        will seek it yet again.

024:001 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be
        with them.

024:002 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of
        mischief.

024:003 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is
        established:

024:004 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all
        precious and pleasant riches.

024:005 A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth
        strength.

024:006 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude
        of counsellors there is safety.

024:007 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the
        gate.

024:008 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous
        person.

024:009 The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an
        abomination to men.

024:010 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.

024:011 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and
        those that are ready to be slain;

024:012 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that
        pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul,
        doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man
        according to his works?

024:013 My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb,
        which is sweet to thy taste:

024:014 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou
        hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy
        expectation shall not be cut off.

024:015 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the
        righteous; spoil not his resting place:

024:016 For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but
        the wicked shall fall into mischief.

024:017 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart
        be glad when he stumbleth:

024:018 Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away
        his wrath from him.

024:019 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious
        at the wicked:

024:020 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of
        the wicked shall be put out.

024:021 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with
        them that are given to change:

024:022 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the
        ruin of them both?

024:023 These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have
        respect of persons in judgment.

024:024 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall
        the people curse, nations shall abhor him:

024:025 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good
        blessing shall come upon them.

024:026 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.

024:027 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the
        field; and afterwards build thine house.

024:028 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and
        deceive not with thy lips.

024:029 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will
        render to the man according to his work.

024:030 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of
        the man void of understanding;

024:031 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had
        covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was
        broken down.

024:032 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and
        received instruction.

024:033 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
        hands to sleep:

024:034 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want
        as an armed man.

025:001 These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah
        king of Judah copied out.

025:002 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of
        kings is to search out a matter.

025:003 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart
        of kings is unsearchable.

025:004 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come
        forth a vessel for the finer.

025:005 Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne
        shall be established in righteousness.

025:006 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand
        not in the place of great men:

025:007 For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither;
        than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the
        prince whom thine eyes have seen.

025:008 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do
        in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.

025:009 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not
        a secret to another:

025:010 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy
        turn not away.

025:011 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of
        silver.

025:012 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a
        wise reprover upon an obedient ear.

025:013 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
        messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of
        his masters.

025:014 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind
        without rain.

025:015 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue
        breaketh the bone.

025:016 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee,
        lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.

025:017 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary
        of thee, and so hate thee.

025:018 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a
        maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.

025:019 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a
        broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.

025:020 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as
        vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy
        heart.

025:021 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be
        thirsty, give him water to drink:

025:022 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD
        shall reward thee.

025:023 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance
        a backbiting tongue.

025:024 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with
        a brawling woman and in a wide house.

025:025 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far
        country.

025:026 A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a
        troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.

025:027 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their
        own glory is not glory.

025:028 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that
        is broken down, and without walls.

026:001 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not
        seemly for a fool.

026:002 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the
        curse causeless shall not come.

026:003 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the
        fool's back.

026:004 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be
        like unto him.

026:005 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his
        own conceit.

026:006 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off
        the feet, and drinketh damage.

026:007 The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the
        mouth of fools.

026:008 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth
        honour to a fool.

026:009 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a
        parable in the mouths of fools.

026:010 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool,
        and rewardeth transgressors.

026:011 As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his
        folly.

026:012 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope
        of a fool than of him.

026:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is
        in the streets.

026:014 As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon
        his bed.

026:015 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to
        bring it again to his mouth.

026:016 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that
        can render a reason.

026:017 He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to
        him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.

026:018 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,

026:019 So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not
        I in sport?

026:020 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is
        no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.

026:021 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a
        contentious man to kindle strife.

026:022 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
        the innermost parts of the belly.

026:023 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered
        with silver dross.

026:024 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit
        within him;

026:025 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven
        abominations in his heart.

026:026 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
        shewed before the whole congregation.

026:027 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a
        stone, it will return upon him.

026:028 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a
        flattering mouth worketh ruin.

027:001 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a
        day may bring forth.

027:002 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a
        stranger, and not thine own lips.

027:003 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is
        heavier than them both.

027:004 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to
        stand before envy?

027:005 Open rebuke is better than secret love.

027:006 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an
        enemy are deceitful.

027:007 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul
        every bitter thing is sweet.

027:008 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that
        wandereth from his place.

027:009 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness
        of a man's friend by hearty counsel.

027:010 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
        neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy
        calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a
        brother far off.

027:011 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him
        that reproacheth me.

027:012 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the
        simple pass on, and are punished.

027:013 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a
        pledge of him for a strange woman.

027:014 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in
        the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.

027:015 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious
        woman are alike.

027:016 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his
        right hand, which bewrayeth itself.

027:017 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of
        his friend.

027:018 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he
        that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

027:019 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to
        man.

027:020 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are
        never satisfied.

027:021 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is
        a man to his praise.

027:022 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with
        a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.

027:023 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look
        well to thy herds.

027:024 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to
        every generation?

027:025 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and
        herbs of the mountains are gathered.

027:026 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of
        the field.

027:027 And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the
        food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy
        maidens.

028:001 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are
        bold as a lion.

028:002 For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof:
        but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof
        shall be prolonged.

028:003 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain
        which leaveth no food.

028:004 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep
        the law contend with them.

028:005 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD
        understand all things.

028:006 Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he
        that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.

028:007 Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a
        companion of riotous men shameth his father.

028:008 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he
        shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.

028:009 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his
        prayer shall be abomination.

028:010 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he
        shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall
        have good things in possession.

028:011 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that
        hath understanding searcheth him out.

028:012 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when
        the wicked rise, a man is hidden.

028:013 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso
        confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

028:014 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his
        heart shall fall into mischief.

028:015 As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler
        over the poor people.

028:016 The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great
        oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his
        days.

028:017 A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall
        flee to the pit; let no man stay him.

028:018 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is
        perverse in his ways shall fall at once.

028:019 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he
        that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.

028:020 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh
        haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

028:021 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of
        bread that man will transgress.

028:022 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth
        not that poverty shall come upon him.

028:023 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than
        he that flattereth with the tongue.

028:024 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no
        transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.

028:025 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that
        putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.

028:026 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh
        wisely, he shall be delivered.

028:027 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that
        hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.

028:028 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they
        perish, the righteous increase.

029:001 He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall
        suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.

029:002 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but
        when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.

029:003 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth
        company with harlots spendeth his substance.

029:004 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that
        receiveth gifts overthroweth it.

029:005 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his
        feet.

029:006 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the
        righteous doth sing and rejoice.

029:007 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the
        wicked regardeth not to know it.

029:008 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away
        wrath.

029:009 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage
        or laugh, there is no rest.

029:010 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.

029:011 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in
        till afterwards.

029:012 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.

029:013 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD
        lighteneth both their eyes.

029:014 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be
        established for ever.

029:015 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself
        bringeth his mother to shame.

029:016 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but
        the righteous shall see their fall.

029:017 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall
        give delight unto thy soul.

029:018 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that
        keepeth the law, happy is he.

029:019 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he
        understand he will not answer.

029:020 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more
        hope of a fool than of him.

029:021 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall
        have him become his son at the length.

029:022 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth
        in transgression.

029:023 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the
        humble in spirit.

029:024 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth
        cursing, and bewrayeth it not.

029:025 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust
        in the LORD shall be safe.

029:026 Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh
        from the LORD.

029:027 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is
        upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.

030:001 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man
        spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,

030:002 Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the
        understanding of a man.

030:003 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.

030:004 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath
        gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a
        garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what
        is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?

030:005 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put
        their trust in him.

030:006 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be
        found a liar.

030:007 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I
        die:

030:008 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty
        nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:

030:009 Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or
        lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in
        vain.

030:010 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and
        thou be found guilty.

030:011 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not
        bless their mother.

030:012 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet
        is not washed from their filthiness.

030:013 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their
        eyelids are lifted up.

030:014 There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their
        jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth,
        and the needy from among men.

030:015 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There
        are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things
        say not, It is enough:

030:016 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled
        with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.

030:017 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his
        mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the
        young eagles shall eat it.

030:018 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea,
        four which I know not:

030:019 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a
        rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way
        of a man with a maid.

030:020 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth
        her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

030:021 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which
        it cannot bear:

030:022 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled
        with meat;

030:023 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that
        is heir to her mistress.

030:024 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they
        are exceeding wise:

030:025 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat
        in the summer;

030:026 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses
        in the rocks;

030:027 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by
        bands;

030:028 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings'
        palaces.

030:029 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in
        going:

030:030 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away
        for any;

030:031 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there
        is no rising up.

030:032 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou
        hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.

030:033 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the
        wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of
        wrath bringeth forth strife.

031:001 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught
        him.

031:002 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son
        of my vows?

031:003 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which
        destroyeth kings.

031:004 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink
        wine; nor for princes strong drink:

031:005 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment
        of any of the afflicted.

031:006 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine
        unto those that be of heavy hearts.

031:007 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery
        no more.

031:008 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are
        appointed to destruction.

031:009 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the
        poor and needy.

031:010 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above
        rubies.

031:011 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he
        shall have no need of spoil.

031:012 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

031:013 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her
        hands.

031:014 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from
        afar.

031:015 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her
        household, and a portion to her maidens.

031:016 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her
        hands she planteth a vineyard.

031:017 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her
        arms.

031:018 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth
        not out by night.

031:019 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the
        distaff.

031:020 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth
        forth her hands to the needy.

031:021 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her
        household are clothed with scarlet.

031:022 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk
        and purple.

031:023 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the
        elders of the land.

031:024 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles
        unto the merchant.

031:025 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in
        time to come.

031:026 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the
        law of kindness.

031:027 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not
        the bread of idleness.

031:028 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,
        and he praiseth her.

031:029 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them
        all.

031:030 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that
        feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.

031:031 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works
        praise her in the gates.

Book 21	Ecclesiastes

001:001 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in
        Jerusalem.

001:002 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities;
        all is vanity.

001:003 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under
        the sun?

001:004 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh:
        but the earth abideth for ever.

001:005 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to
        his place where he arose.

001:006 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the
        north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth
        again according to his circuits.

001:007 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto
        the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return
        again.

001:008 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is
        not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

001:009 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that
        which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new
        thing under the sun.

001:010 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?
        it hath been already of old time, which was before us.

001:011 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there
        be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that
        shall come after.

001:012 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

001:013 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom
        concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore
        travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised
        therewith.

001:014 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,
        behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

001:015 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which
        is wanting cannot be numbered.

001:016 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great
        estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have
        been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great
        experience of wisdom and knowledge.

001:017 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
        folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

001:018 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
        knowledge increaseth sorrow.

002:001 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,
        therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.

002:002 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?

002:003 I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet
        acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly,
        till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which
        they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.

002:004 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
        vineyards:

002:005 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of
        all kind of fruits:

002:006 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that
        bringeth forth trees:

002:007 I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my
        house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle
        above all that were in Jerusalem before me:

002:008 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure
        of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women
        singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical
        instruments, and that of all sorts.

002:009 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before
        me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.

002:010 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I
        withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in
        all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.

002:011 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and
        on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was
        vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under
        the sun.

002:012 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly:
        for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that
        which hath been already done.

002:013 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light
        excelleth darkness.

002:014 The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in
        darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth
        to them all.

002:015 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it
        happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I
        said in my heart, that this also is vanity.

002:016 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool
        for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall
        all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.

002:017 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under
        the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of
        spirit.

002:018 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
        because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

002:019 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet
        shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured,
        and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is
        also vanity.

002:020 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
        labour which I took under the sun.

002:021 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in
        knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured
        therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity
        and a great evil.

002:022 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of
        his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?

002:023 For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his
        heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.

002:024 There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and
        drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his
        labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.

002:025 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?

002:026 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and
        knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to
        gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good
        before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

003:001 To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose
        under the heaven:

003:002 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a
        time to pluck up that which is planted;

003:003 A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and
        a time to build up;

003:004 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a
        time to dance;

003:005 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones
        together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from
        embracing;

003:006 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time
        to cast away;

003:007 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and
        a time to speak;

003:008 A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time
        of peace.

003:009 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?

003:010 I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of
        men to be exercised in it.

003:011 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath
        set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the
        work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.

003:012 I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to
        rejoice, and to do good in his life.

003:013 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the
        good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.

003:014 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever:
        nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God
        doeth it, that men should fear before him.

003:015 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath
        already been; and God requireth that which is past.

003:016 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
        wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that
        iniquity was there.

003:017 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
        wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for
        every work.

003:018 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,
        that God might manifest them, and that they might see that
        they themselves are beasts.

003:019 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
        even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
        other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no
        preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.

003:020 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to
        dust again.

003:021 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the
        spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?

003:022 Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a
        man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion:
        for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

004:001 So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are
        done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were
        oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their
        oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.

004:002 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than
        the living which are yet alive.

004:003 Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who
        hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

004:004 Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that
        for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity
        and vexation of spirit.

004:005 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

004:006 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full
        with travail and vexation of spirit.

004:007 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

004:008 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath
        neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his
        labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither
        saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?
        This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.

004:009 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for
        their labour.

004:010 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to
        him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to
        help him up.

004:011 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can
        one be warm alone?

004:012 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a
        threefold cord is not quickly broken.

004:013 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish
        king, who will no more be admonished.

004:014 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is
        born in his kingdom becometh poor.

004:015 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the
        second child that shall stand up in his stead.

004:016 There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been
        before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in
        him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

005:001 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more
        ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they
        consider not that they do evil.

005:002 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty
        to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou
        upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.

005:003 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a
        fool's voice is known by multitude of words.

005:004 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he
        hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.

005:005 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou
        shouldest vow and not pay.

005:006 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say
        thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should
        God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine
        hands?

005:007 For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also
        divers vanities: but fear thou God.

005:008 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent
        perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not
        at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest
        regardeth; and there be higher than they.

005:009 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself
        is served by the field.

005:010 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor
        he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.

005:011 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and
        what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding
        of them with their eyes?

005:012 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little
        or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to
        sleep.

005:013 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
        riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.

005:014 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a
        son, and there is nothing in his hand.

005:015 As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return
        to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which
        he may carry away in his hand.

005:016 And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came,
        so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for
        the wind?

005:017 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much
        sorrow and wrath with his sickness.

005:018 Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one
        to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour
        that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which
        God giveth him: for it is his portion.

005:019 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and
        hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion,
        and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.

005:020 For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because
        God answereth him in the joy of his heart.

006:001 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is
        common among men:

006:002 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so
        that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth,
        yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger
        eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.

006:003 If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so
        that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled
        with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an
        untimely birth is better than he.

006:004 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and
        his name shall be covered with darkness.

006:005 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this
        hath more rest than the other.

006:006 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he
        seen no good: do not all go to one place?

006:007 All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite
        is not filled.

006:008 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,
        that knoweth to walk before the living?

006:009 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the
        desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

006:010 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it
        is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than
        he.

006:011 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man
        the better?

006:012 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the
        days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who
        can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?

007:001 A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of
        death than the day of one's birth.

007:002 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the
        house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the
        living will lay it to his heart.

007:003 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
        countenance the heart is made better.

007:004 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the
        heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

007:005 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to
        hear the song of fools.

007:006 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter
        of the fool: this also is vanity.

007:007 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth
        the heart.

007:008 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and
        the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

007:009 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in
        the bosom of fools.

007:010 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were
        better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning
        this.

007:011 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit
        to them that see the sun.

007:012 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the
        excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them
        that have it.

007:013 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight,
        which he hath made crooked?

007:014 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of
        adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the
        other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.

007:015 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a
        just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a
        wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

007:016 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise:
        why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?

007:017 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why
        shouldest thou die before thy time?

007:018 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also
        from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God
        shall come forth of them all.

007:019 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which
        are in the city.

007:020 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
        sinneth not.

007:021 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou
        hear thy servant curse thee:

007:022 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself
        likewise hast cursed others.

007:023 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but
        it was far from me.

007:024 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it
        out?

007:025 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
        wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness
        of folly, even of foolishness and madness:

007:026 And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is
        snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God
        shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

007:027 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by
        one, to find out the account:

007:028 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a
        thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not
        found.

007:029 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright;
        but they have sought out many inventions.

008:001 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of
        a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the
        boldness of his face shall be changed.

008:002 I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in
        regard of the oath of God.

008:003 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil
        thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

008:004 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say
        unto him, What doest thou?

008:005 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a
        wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

008:006 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore
        the misery of man is great upon him.

008:007 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him
        when it shall be?

008:008 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the
        spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there
        is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver
        those that are given to it.

008:009 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work
        that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man
        ruleth over another to his own hurt.

008:010 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the
        place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where
        they had so done: this is also vanity.

008:011 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
        speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set
        in them to do evil.

008:012 Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be
        prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them
        that fear God, which fear before him:

008:013 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he
        prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth
        not before God.

008:014 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be
        just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the
        wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth
        according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also
        is vanity.

008:015 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing
        under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for
        that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life,
        which God giveth him under the sun.

008:016 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the
        business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that
        neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)

008:017 Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out
        the work that is done under the sun: because though a man
        labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther;
        though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able
        to find it.

009:001 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all
        this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are
        in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by
        all that is before them.

009:002 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the
        righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean,
        and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that
        sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that
        sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.

009:003 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun,
        that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the
        sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart
        while they live, and after that they go to the dead.

009:004 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for
        a living dog is better than a dead lion.

009:005 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not
        any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory
        of them is forgotten.

009:006 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now
        perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any
        thing that is done under the sun.

009:007 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a
        merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.

009:008 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no
        ointment.

009:009 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of
        the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the
        sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in
        this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.

009:010 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for
        there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in
        the grave, whither thou goest.

009:011 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the
        swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the
        wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour
        to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

009:012 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are
        taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the
        snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it
        falleth suddenly upon them.

009:013 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed
        great unto me:

009:014 There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came
        a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great
        bulwarks against it:

009:015 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his
        wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same
        poor man.

009:016 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the
        poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.

009:017 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of
        him that ruleth among fools.

009:018 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner
        destroyeth much good.

010:001 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth
        a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in
        reputation for wisdom and honour.

010:002 A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at
        his left.

010:003 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his
        wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a
        fool.

010:004 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy
        place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.

010:005 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error
        which proceedeth from the ruler:

010:006 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

010:007 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as
        servants upon the earth.

010:008 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh
        an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

010:009 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that
        cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.

010:010 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must
        he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

010:011 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a
        babbler is no better.

010:012 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of
        a fool will swallow up himself.

010:013 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and
        the end of his talk is mischievous madness.

010:014 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
        and what shall be after him, who can tell him?

010:015 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because
        he knoweth not how to go to the city.

010:016 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes
        eat in the morning!

010:017 Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles,
        and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for
        drunkenness!

010:018 By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through
        idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.

010:019 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
        answereth all things.

010:020 Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the
        rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the
        voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.

011:001 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after
        many days.

011:002 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest
        not what evil shall be upon the earth.

011:003 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the
        earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the
        north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.

011:004 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that
        regardeth the clouds shall not reap.

011:005 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the
        bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so
        thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.

011:006 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not
        thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either
        this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.

011:007 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the
        eyes to behold the sun:

011:008 But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let
        him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All
        that cometh is vanity.

011:009 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer
        thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine
        heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for
        all these things God will bring thee into judgment.

011:010 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from
        thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.

012:001 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
        evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt
        say, I have no pleasure in them;

012:002 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
        darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:

012:003 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and
        the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease
        because they are few, and those that look out of the windows
        be darkened,

012:004 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of
        the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the
        bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;

012:005 Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and
        fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish,
        and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail:
        because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about
        the streets:

012:006 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be
        broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel
        broken at the cistern.

012:007 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
        spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

012:008 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.

012:009 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught
        the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out,
        and set in order many proverbs.

012:010 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that
        which was written was upright, even words of truth.

012:011 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by
        the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.

012:012 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many
        books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the
        flesh.

012:013 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
        keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

012:014 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every
        secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.

Book 22	Song of Solomon

001:001 The song of songs, which is Solomon's.

001:002 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is
        better than wine.

001:003 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as
        ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.

001:004 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into
        his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will
        remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.

001:005 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the
        tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

001:006 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath
        looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they
        made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard
        have I not kept.

001:007 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where
        thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as
        one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

001:008 If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth
        by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the
        shepherds' tents.

001:009 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in
        Pharaoh's chariots.

001:010 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with
        chains of gold.

001:011 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.

001:012 While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth
        forth the smell thereof.

001:013 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all
        night betwixt my breasts.

001:014 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the
        vineyards of Engedi.

001:015 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou
        hast doves' eyes.

001:016 Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed
        is green.

001:017 The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.

002:001 I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.

002:002 As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.

002:003 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my
        beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great
        delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.

002:004 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me
        was love.

002:005 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of
        love.

002:006 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth
        embrace me.

002:007 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by
        the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my
        love, till he please.

002:008 The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the
        mountains, skipping upon the hills.

002:009 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth
        behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing
        himself through the lattice.

002:010 My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair
        one, and come away.

002:011 For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;

002:012 The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of
        birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our
        land;

002:013 The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with
        the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair
        one, and come away.

002:014 O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret
        places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear
        thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is
        comely.

002:015 Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for
        our vines have tender grapes.

002:016 My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.

002:017 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my
        beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the
        mountains of Bether.

003:001 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought
        him, but I found him not.

003:002 I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in
        the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought
        him, but I found him not.

003:003 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said,
        Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?

003:004 It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him
        whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go,
        until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the
        chamber of her that conceived me.

003:005 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by
        the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my
        love, till he please.

003:006 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of
        smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders
        of the merchant?

003:007 Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are
        about it, of the valiant of Israel.

003:008 They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his
        sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.

003:009 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.

003:010 He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of
        gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being
        paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.

003:011 Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with
        the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his
        espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

004:001 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou
        hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of
        goats, that appear from mount Gilead.

004:002 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which
        came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and
        none is barren among them.

004:003 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is
        comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within
        thy locks.

004:004 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury,
        whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty
        men.

004:005 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which
        feed among the lilies.

004:006 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me
        to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

004:007 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.

004:008 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon:
        look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon,
        from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

004:009 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast
        ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of
        thy neck.

004:010 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is
        thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all
        spices!

004:011 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk
        are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like
        the smell of Lebanon.

004:012 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a
        fountain sealed.

004:013 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant
        fruits; camphire, with spikenard,

004:014 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of
        frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:

004:015 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams
        from Lebanon.

004:016 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my
        garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved
        come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.

005:001 I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have
        gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb
        with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O
        friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.

005:002 I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved
        that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my
        dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my
        locks with the drops of the night.

005:003 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed
        my feet; how shall I defile them?

005:004 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my
        bowels were moved for him.

005:005 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with
        myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the
        handles of the lock.

005:006 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself,
        and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but
        I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

005:007 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me,
        they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil
        from me.

005:008 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved,
        that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.

005:009 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest
        among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved,
        that thou dost so charge us?

005:010 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten
        thousand.

005:011 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and
        black as a raven.

005:012 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters,
        washed with milk, and fitly set.

005:013 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips
        like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

005:014 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is
        as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.

005:015 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine
        gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

005:016 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is
        my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

006:001 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women?
        whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with
        thee.

006:002 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of
        spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

006:003 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among
        the lilies.

006:004 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem,
        terrible as an army with banners.

006:005 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy
        hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

006:006 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the
        washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one
        barren among them.

006:007 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.

006:008 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and
        virgins without number.

006:009 My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her
        mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The
        daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the
        concubines, and they praised her.

006:010 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the
        moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?

006:011 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the
        valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the
        pomegranates budded.

006:012 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of
        Amminadib.

006:013 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look
        upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the
        company of two armies.

007:001 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter!
        the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the
        hands of a cunning workman.

007:002 Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor:
        thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.

007:003 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.

007:004 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools
        in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the
        tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.

007:005 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine
        head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.

007:006 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!

007:007 This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to
        clusters of grapes.

007:008 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the
        boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of
        the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;

007:009 And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved,
        that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are
        asleep to speak.

007:010 I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.

007:011 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge
        in the villages.

007:012 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine
        flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the
        pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.

007:013 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of
        pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O
        my beloved.

008:001 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my
        mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;
        yea, I should not be despised.

008:002 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who
        would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine
        of the juice of my pomegranate.

008:003 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand
        should embrace me.

008:004 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up,
        nor awake my love, until he please.

008:005 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon
        her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy
        mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that
        bare thee.

008:006 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm:
        for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave:
        the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most
        vehement flame.

008:007 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown
        it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for
        love, it would utterly be contemned.

008:008 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall
        we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

008:009 If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver:
        and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of
        cedar.

008:010 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his
        eyes as one that found favour.

008:011 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard
        unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a
        thousand pieces of silver.

008:012 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon,
        must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof
        two hundred.

008:013 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to
        thy voice: cause me to hear it.

008:014 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a
        young hart upon the mountains of spices.

Book 23	Isaiah

001:001 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning
        Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and
        Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

001:002 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath
        spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they
        have rebelled against me.

001:003 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but
        Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.

001:004 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
        evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken
        the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto
        anger, they are gone away backward.

001:005 Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and
        more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

001:006 From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no
        soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying
        sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither
        mollified with ointment.

001:007 Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire:
        your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is
        desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

001:008 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard,
        as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

001:009 Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small
        remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been
        like unto Gomorrah.

001:010 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto
        the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

001:011 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
        saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and
        the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of
        bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.

001:012 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at
        your hand, to tread my courts?

001:013 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto
        me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I
        cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.

001:014 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they
        are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.

001:015 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
        from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear:
        your hands are full of blood.

001:016 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings
        from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;

001:017 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge
        the fatherless, plead for the widow.

001:018 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though
        your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
        though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

001:019 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the
        land:

001:020 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the
        sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

001:021 How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of
        judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.

001:022 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:

001:023 Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every
        one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not
        the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto
        them.

001:024 Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of
        Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me
        of mine enemies:

001:025 And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy
        dross, and take away all thy tin:

001:026 And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy
        counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be
        called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.

001:027 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
        righteousness.

001:028 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners
        shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be
        consumed.

001:029 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired,
        and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have
        chosen.

001:030 For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden
        that hath no water.

001:031 And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a
        spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall
        quench them.

002:001 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
        Jerusalem.

002:002 And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain
        of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the
        mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all
        nations shall flow unto it.

002:003 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to
        the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob;
        and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
        paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of
        the LORD from Jerusalem.

002:004 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
        people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and
        their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword
        against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

002:005 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the
        LORD.

002:006 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,
        because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers
        like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the
        children of strangers.

002:007 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there
        any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses,
        neither is there any end of their chariots:

002:008 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of
        their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:

002:009 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth
        himself: therefore forgive them not.

002:010 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of
        the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.

002:011 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness
        of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be
        exalted in that day.

002:012 For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that
        is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and
        he shall be brought low:

002:013 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted
        up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,

002:014 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that
        are lifted up,

002:015 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,

002:016 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant
        pictures.

002:017 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the
        haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall
        be exalted in that day.

002:018 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.

002:019 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the
        caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of
        his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

002:020 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his
        idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to
        worship, to the moles and to the bats;

002:021 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the
        ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his
        majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

002:022 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for
        wherein is he to be accounted of ?

003:001 For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from
        Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole
        stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.

003:002 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the
        prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,

003:003 The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the
        counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent
        orator.

003:004 And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall
        rule over them.

003:005 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and
        every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself
        proudly against the ancient, and the base against the
        honourable.

003:006 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his
        father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let
        this ruin be under thy hand:

003:007 In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer;
        for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a
        ruler of the people.

003:008 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their
        tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the
        eyes of his glory.

003:009 The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and
        they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto
        their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.

003:010 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for
        they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

003:011 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward
        of his hands shall be given him.

003:012 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women
        rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee
        to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.

003:013 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the
        people.

003:014 The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his
        people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the
        vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.

003:015 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the
        faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

003:016 Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are
        haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes,
        walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with
        their feet:

003:017 Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the
        head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover
        their secret parts.

003:018 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their
        tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and
        their round tires like the moon,

003:019 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,

003:020 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands,
        and the tablets, and the earrings,

003:021 The rings, and nose jewels,

003:022 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the
        wimples, and the crisping pins,

003:023 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.

003:024 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there
        shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of
        well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding
        of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.

003:025 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

003:026 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate
        shall sit upon the ground.

004:001 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man,
        saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel:
        only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.

004:002 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and
        glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and
        comely for them that are escaped of Israel.

004:003 And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and
        he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even
        every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:

004:004 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the
        daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of
        Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment,
        and by the spirit of burning.

004:005 And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount
        Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and
        the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory
        shall be a defence.

004:006 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time
        from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert
        from storm and from rain.

005:001 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved
        touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a
        very fruitful hill:

005:002 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and
        planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the
        midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked
        that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild
        grapes.

005:003 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
        I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.

005:004 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not
        done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring
        forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?

005:005 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard:
        I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up;
        and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:

005:006 And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged;
        but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command
        the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.

005:007 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel,
        and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for
        judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold
        a cry.

005:008 Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to
        field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone
        in the midst of the earth!

005:009 In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses
        shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.

005:010 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed
        of an homer shall yield an ephah.

005:011 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may
        follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine
        inflame them!

005:012 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine,
        are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD,
        neither consider the operation of his hands.

005:013 Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have
        no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their
        multitude dried up with thirst.

005:014 Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth
        without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and
        their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.

005:015 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man
        shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:

005:016 But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God
        that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.

005:017 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste
        places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

005:018 Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin
        as it were with a cart rope:

005:019 That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may
        see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw
        nigh and come, that we may know it!

005:020 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put
        darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter
        for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

005:021 Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in
        their own sight!

005:022 Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of
        strength to mingle strong drink:

005:023 Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the
        righteousness of the righteous from him!

005:024 Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame
        consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and
        their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away
        the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the
        Holy One of Israel.

005:025 Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people,
        and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath
        smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases
        were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger
        is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

005:026 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and
        will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold,
        they shall come with speed swiftly:

005:027 None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber
        nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed,
        nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:

005:028 Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses'
        hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a
        whirlwind:

005:029 Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young
        lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and
        shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.

005:030 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring
        of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and
        sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

006:001 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting
        upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the
        temple.

006:002 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with
        twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,
        and with twain he did fly.

006:003 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the
        LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.

006:004 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that
        cried, and the house was filled with smoke.

006:005 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of
        unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean
        lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.

006:006 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in
        his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the
        altar:

006:007 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched
        thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin
        purged.

006:008 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send,
        and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.

006:009 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but
        understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.

006:010 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy,
        and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear
        with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert,
        and be healed.

006:011 Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities
        be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and
        the land be utterly desolate,

006:012 And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great
        forsaking in the midst of the land.

006:013 But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall
        be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in
        them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be
        the substance thereof.

007:001 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the
        son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria,
        and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward
        Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.

007:002 And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is
        confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the
        heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with
        the wind.

007:003 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz,
        thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of
        the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;

007:004 And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither
        be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands,
        for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of
        Remaliah.

007:005 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken
        evil counsel against thee, saying,

007:006 Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a
        breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even
        the son of Tabeal:

007:007 Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it
        come to pass.

007:008 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is
        Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be
        broken, that it be not a people.

007:009 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
        Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be
        established.

007:010 Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,

007:011 Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the
        depth, or in the height above.

007:012 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.

007:013 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small
        thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?

007:014 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a
        virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
        Immanuel.

007:015 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the
        evil, and choose the good.

007:016 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose
        the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of
        both her kings.

007:017 The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon
        thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that
        Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.

007:018 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
        hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers
        of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

007:019 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the
        desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all
        thorns, and upon all bushes.

007:020 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is
        hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of
        Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also
        consume the beard.

007:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall
        nourish a young cow, and two sheep;

007:022 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they
        shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall
        every one eat that is left in the land.

007:023 And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall
        be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand
        silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.

007:024 With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all
        the land shall become briers and thorns.

007:025 And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there
        shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it
        shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading
        of lesser cattle.

008:001 Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and
        write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.

008:002 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the
        priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

008:003 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a
        son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name
        Mahershalalhashbaz.

008:004 For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father,
        and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
        shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

008:005 The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,

008:006 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that
        go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;

008:007 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the
        waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of
        Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his
        channels, and go over all his banks:

008:008 And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go
        over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out
        of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

008:009 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in
        pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird
        yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves,
        and ye shall be broken in pieces.

008:010 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the
        word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.

008:011 For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and
        instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this
        people, saying,

008:012 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people
        shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be
        afraid.

008:013 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear,
        and let him be your dread.

008:014 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling
        and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a
        gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

008:015 And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken,
        and be snared, and be taken.

008:016 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

008:017 And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the
        house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

008:018 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for
        signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which
        dwelleth in mount Zion.

008:019 And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have
        familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter:
        should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the
        dead?

008:020 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
        to this word, it is because there is no light in them.

008:021 And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and
        it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they
        shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and
        look upward.

008:022 And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and
        darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to
        darkness.

009:001 Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her
        vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of
        Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more
        grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan,
        in Galilee of the nations.

009:002 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light:
        they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them
        hath the light shined.

009:003 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy:
        they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as
        men rejoice when they divide the spoil.

009:004 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of
        his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of
        Midian.

009:005 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and
        garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and
        fuel of fire.

009:006 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
        government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
        called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
        Father, The Prince of Peace.

009:007 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no
        end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order
        it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
        henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will
        perform this.

009:008 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon
        Israel.

009:009 And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant
        of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,

009:010 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn
        stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them
        into cedars.

009:011 Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin
        against him, and join his enemies together;

009:012 The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall
        devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not
        turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

009:013 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither
        do they seek the LORD of hosts.

009:014 Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail,
        branch and rush, in one day.

009:015 The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet
        that teacheth lies, he is the tail.

009:016 For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they
        that are led of them are destroyed.

009:017 Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men,
        neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for
        every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth
        speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but
        his hand is stretched out still.

009:018 For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers
        and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest,
        and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.

009:019 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened,
        and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall
        spare his brother.

009:020 And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he
        shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied:
        they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:

009:021 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together
        shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned
        away, but his hand is stretched out still.

010:001 Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
        grievousness which they have prescribed;

010:002 To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the
        right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their
        prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!

010:003 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the
        desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for
        help? and where will ye leave your glory?

010:004 Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they
        shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not
        turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

010:005 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand
        is mine indignation.

010:006 I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against
        the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the
        spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the
        mire of the streets.

010:007 Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so;
        but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a
        few.

010:008 For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?

010:009 Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not
        Samaria as Damascus?

010:010 As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose
        graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;

010:011 Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do
        to Jerusalem and her idols?

010:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath
        performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I
        will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of
        Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

010:013 For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and
        by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds
        of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put
        down the inhabitants like a valiant man:

010:014 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and
        as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the
        earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the
        mouth, or peeped.

010:015 Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?
        or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?
        as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it
        up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no
        wood.

010:016 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his
        fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a
        burning like the burning of a fire.

010:017 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One
        for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his
        briers in one day;

010:018 And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful
        field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a
        standard-bearer fainteth.

010:019 And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a
        child may write them.

010:020 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
        Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall
        no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay
        upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

010:021 The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the
        mighty God.

010:022 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
        remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall
        overflow with righteousness.

010:023 For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even
        determined, in the midst of all the land.

010:024 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that
        dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall
        smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against
        thee, after the manner of Egypt.

010:025 For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease,
        and mine anger in their destruction.

010:026 And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him
        according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and
        as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the
        manner of Egypt.

010:027 And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall
        be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy
        neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the
        anointing.

010:028 He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he
        hath laid up his carriages:

010:029 They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their
        lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.

010:030 Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard
        unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.

010:031 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather
        themselves to flee.

010:032 As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his
        hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of
        Jerusalem.

010:033 Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with
        terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and
        the haughty shall be humbled.

010:034 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
        and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

011:001 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and
        a Branch shall grow out of his roots:

011:002 And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of
        wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the
        spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;

011:003 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the
        LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes,
        neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:

011:004 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove
        with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the
        earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his
        lips shall he slay the wicked.

011:005 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
        faithfulness the girdle of his reins.

011:006 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall
        lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the
        fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.

011:007 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall
        lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

011:008 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and
        the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.

011:009 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for
        the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the
        waters cover the sea.

011:010 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall
        stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles
        seek: and his rest shall be glorious.

011:011 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set
        his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his
        people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and
        from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar,
        and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.

011:012 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall
        assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the
        dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

011:013 The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of
        Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and
        Judah shall not vex Ephraim.

011:014 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines
        toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together:
        they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children
        of Ammon shall obey them.

011:015 And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian
        sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the
        river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men
        go over dryshod.

011:016 And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people,
        which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in
        the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.

012:001 And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee:
        though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away,
        and thou comfortedst me.

012:002 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid:
        for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is
        become my salvation.

012:003 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of
        salvation.

012:004 And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his
        name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that
        his name is exalted.

012:005 Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is
        known in all the earth.

012:006 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the
        Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.

013:001 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

013:002 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice
        unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of
        the nobles.

013:003 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my
        mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my
        highness.

013:004 The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great
        people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered
        together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

013:005 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the
        LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole
        land.

013:006 Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as
        a destruction from the Almighty.

013:007 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart
        shall melt:

013:008 And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of
        them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they
        shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as
        flames.

013:009 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and
        fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy
        the sinners thereof out of it.

013:010 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall
        not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going
        forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.

013:011 And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for
        their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to
        cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

013:012 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man
        than the golden wedge of Ophir.

013:013 Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove
        out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in
        the day of his fierce anger.

013:014 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man
        taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and
        flee every one into his own land.

013:015 Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one
        that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.

013:016 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their
        eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.

013:017 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not
        regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.

013:018 Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they
        shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall
        not spare children.

013:019 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the
        Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and
        Gomorrah.

013:020 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from
        generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent
        there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.

013:021 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their
        houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall
        dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.

013:022 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate
        houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is
        near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

014:001 For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
        Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers
        shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house
        of Jacob.

014:002 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place:
        and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the
        LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them
        captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over
        their oppressors.

014:003 And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give
        thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the
        hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,

014:004 That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of
        Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden
        city ceased!

014:005 The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre
        of the rulers.

014:006 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he
        that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none
        hindereth.

014:007 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth
        into singing.

014:008 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon,
        saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against
        us.

014:009 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy
        coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief
        ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all
        the kings of the nations.

014:010 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become
        weak as we? art thou become like unto us?

014:011 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy
        viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover
        thee.

014:012 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
        morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst
        weaken the nations!

014:013 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven,
        I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also
        upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:

014:014 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like
        the most High.

014:015 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the
        pit.

014:016 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider
        thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble,
        that did shake kingdoms;

014:017 That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities
        thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

014:018 All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory,
        every one in his own house.

014:019 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,
        and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through
        with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a
        carcase trodden under feet.

014:020 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou
        hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of
        evildoers shall never be renowned.

014:021 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their
        fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill
        the face of the world with cities.

014:022 For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and
        cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and
        nephew, saith the LORD.

014:023 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of
        water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction,
        saith the LORD of hosts.

014:024 The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have
        thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so
        shall it stand:

014:025 That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my
        mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart
        from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.

014:026 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and
        this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

014:027 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul
        it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

014:028 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

014:029 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that
        smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come
        forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying
        serpent.

014:030 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall
        lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and
        he shall slay thy remnant.

014:031 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art
        dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and
        none shall be alone in his appointed times.

014:032 What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That
        the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall
        trust in it.

015:001 The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid
        waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of
        Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;

015:002 He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to
        weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their
        heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.

015:003 In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on
        the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one
        shall howl, weeping abundantly.

015:004 And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard
        even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall
        cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.

015:005 My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto
        Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of
        Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of
        Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.

015:006 For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is
        withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.

015:007 Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they
        have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the
        willows.

015:008 For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the
        howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto
        Beerelim.

015:009 For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will
        bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab,
        and upon the remnant of the land.

016:001 Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the
        wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.

016:002 For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the
        nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.

016:003 Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night
        in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him
        that wandereth.

016:004 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to
        them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at
        an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out
        of the land.

016:005 And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit
        upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and
        seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.

016:006 We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of
        his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies
        shall not be so.

016:007 Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for
        the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are
        stricken.

016:008 For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah:
        the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants
        thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through
        the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone
        over the sea.

016:009 Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of
        Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and
        Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy
        harvest is fallen.

016:010 And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful
        field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither
        shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine
        in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.

016:011 Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and
        mine inward parts for Kirharesh.

016:012 And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary
        on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to
        pray; but he shall not prevail.

016:013 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab
        since that time.

016:014 But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as
        the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be
        contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant
        shall be very small and feeble.

017:001 The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from
        being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.

017:002 The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks,
        which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

017:003 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom
        from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the
        glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.

017:004 And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob
        shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax
        lean.

017:005 And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and
        reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that
        gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.

017:006 Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an
        olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost
        bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof,
        saith the LORD God of Israel.

017:007 At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall
        have respect to the Holy One of Israel.

017:008 And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands,
        neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either
        the groves, or the images.

017:009 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough,
        and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the
        children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.

017:010 Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast
        not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt
        thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange
        slips:

017:011 In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the
        morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the harvest
        shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.

017:012 Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like
        the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that
        make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!

017:013 The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but
        God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall
        be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and
        like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.

017:014 And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he
        is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot
        of them that rob us.

018:001 Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the
        rivers of Ethiopia:

018:002 That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of
        bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to
        a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their
        beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose
        land the rivers have spoiled!

018:003 All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth,
        see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and
        when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.

018:004 For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will
        consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs,
        and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

018:005 For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour
        grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the
        sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the
        branches.

018:006 They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains,
        and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer
        upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon
        them.

018:007 In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of
        hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people
        terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and
        trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the
        place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.

019:001 The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift
        cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall
        be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in
        the midst of it.

019:002 And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they
        shall fight every one against his brother, and every one
        against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against
        kingdom.

019:003 And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I
        will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the
        idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar
        spirits, and to the wizards.

019:004 And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel
        lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord,
        the LORD of hosts.

019:005 And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be
        wasted and dried up.

019:006 And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of
        defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags
        shall wither.

019:007 The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and
        every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away,
        and be no more.

019:008 The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle
        into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon
        the waters shall languish.

019:009 Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave
        networks, shall be confounded.

019:010 And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that
        make sluices and ponds for fish.

019:011 Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise
        counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto
        Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

019:012 Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee
        now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed
        upon Egypt.

019:013 The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are
        deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the
        stay of the tribes thereof.

019:014 The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof:
        and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a
        drunken man staggereth in his vomit.

019:015 Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or
        tail, branch or rush, may do.

019:016 In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be
        afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD
        of hosts, which he shaketh over it.

019:017 And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one
        that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself,
        because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath
        determined against it.

019:018 In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the
        language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall
        be called, The city of destruction.

019:019 In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst
        of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to
        the LORD.

019:020 And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of
        hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD
        because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour,
        and a great one, and he shall deliver them.

019:021 And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall
        know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and
        oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform
        it.

019:022 And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it:
        and they shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be
        intreated of them, and shall heal them.

019:023 In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
        and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into
        Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

019:024 In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with
        Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land:

019:025 Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt
        my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine
        inheritance.

020:001 In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the
        king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took
        it;

020:002 At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz,
        saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put
        off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and
        barefoot.

020:003 And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked
        and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and
        upon Ethiopia;

020:004 So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians
        prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked
        and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame
        of Egypt.

020:005 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their
        expectation, and of Egypt their glory.

020:006 And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold,
        such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be
        delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?

021:001 The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the
        south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a
        terrible land.

021:002 A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer
        dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O
        Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to
        cease.

021:003 Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold
        upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed
        down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.

021:004 My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my
        pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.

021:005 Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise,
        ye princes, and anoint the shield.

021:006 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let
        him declare what he seeth.

021:007 And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of
        asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently
        with much heed:

021:008 And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the
        watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole
        nights:

021:009 And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of
        horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is
        fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken
        unto the ground.

021:010 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have
        heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared
        unto you.

021:011 The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,
        what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

021:012 The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if
        ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.

021:013 The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye
        lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.

021:014 The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that
        was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.

021:015 For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from
        the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

021:016 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according
        to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall
        fail:

021:017 And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of
        the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God
        of Israel hath spoken it.

022:001 The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that
        thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?

022:002 Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, joyous city:
        thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in
        battle.

022:003 All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the
        archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which
        have fled from far.

022:004 Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly,
        labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the
        daughter of my people.

022:005 For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of
        perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision,
        breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.

022:006 And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen,
        and Kir uncovered the shield.

022:007 And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be
        full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in
        array at the gate.

022:008 And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look
        in that day to the armour of the house of the forest.

022:009 Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they
        are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower
        pool.

022:010 And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses
        have ye broken down to fortify the wall.

022:011 Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of
        the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof,
        neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.

022:012 And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and
        to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:

022:013 And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep,
        eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to
        morrow we shall die.

022:014 And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely
        this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith
        the Lord GOD of hosts.

022:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this
        treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,

022:016 What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast
        hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a
        sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation for himself
        in a rock?

022:017 Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity,
        and will surely cover thee.

022:018 He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a
        large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of
        thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house.

022:019 And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state
        shall he pull thee down.

022:020 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my
        servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:

022:021 And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with
        thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand:
        and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and
        to the house of Judah.

022:022 And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his
        shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall
        shut, and none shall open.

022:023 And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall
        be for a glorious throne to his father's house.

022:024 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's
        house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small
        quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of
        flagons.

022:025 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is
        fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and
        fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for
        the LORD hath spoken it.

023:001 The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid
        waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the
        land of Chittim it is revealed to them.

023:002 Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants
        of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.

023:003 And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the
        river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.

023:004 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the
        strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth
        children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up
        virgins.

023:005 As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely
        pained at the report of Tyre.

023:006 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.

023:007 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days?
        her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.

023:008 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city,
        whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the
        honourable of the earth?

023:009 The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all
        glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the
        earth.

023:010 Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish:
        there is no more strength.

023:011 He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms:
        the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city,
        to destroy the strong holds thereof.

023:012 And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed
        virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there
        also shalt thou have no rest.

023:013 Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till
        the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness:
        they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces
        thereof; and he brought it to ruin.

023:014 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.

023:015 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be
        forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king:
        after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.

023:016 Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been
        forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou
        mayest be remembered.

023:017 And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that
        the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and
        shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world
        upon the face of the earth.

023:018 And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the
        LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her
        merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to
        eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.

024:001 Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste,
        and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the
        inhabitants thereof.

024:002 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as
        with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so
        with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as
        with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of
        usury, so with the giver of usury to him.

024:003 The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for
        the LORD hath spoken this word.

024:004 The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and
        fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.

024:005 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;
        because they have transgressed the laws, changed the
        ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.

024:006 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that
        dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the
        earth are burned, and few men left.

024:007 The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the
        merryhearted do sigh.

024:008 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice
        endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.

024:009 They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be
        bitter to them that drink it.

024:010 The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up,
        that no man may come in.

024:011 There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is
        darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.

024:012 In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
        destruction.

024:013 When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the
        people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as
        the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.

024:014 They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the
        majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.

024:015 Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of
        the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.

024:016 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even
        glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness,
        woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously;
        yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.

024:017 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant
        of the earth.

024:018 And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise
        of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out
        of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the
        windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the
        earth do shake.

024:019 The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean
        dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.

024:020 The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be
        removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be
        heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.

024:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
        punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the
        kings of the earth upon the earth.

024:022 And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered
        in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many
        days shall they be visited.

024:023 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when
        the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem,
        and before his ancients gloriously.

025:001 O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy
        name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old
        are faithfulness and truth.

025:002 For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a
        ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be
        built.

025:003 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of
        the terrible nations shall fear thee.

025:004 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
        needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from
        the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm
        against the wall.

025:005 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a
        dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the
        branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.

025:006 And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all
        people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of
        fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

025:007 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
        cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all
        nations.

025:008 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will
        wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his
        people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD
        hath spoken it.

025:009 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
        waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have
        waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

025:010 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab
        shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down
        for the dunghill.

025:011 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as
        he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he
        shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their
        hands.

025:012 And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring
        down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.

026:001 In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We
        have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and
        bulwarks.

026:002 Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the
        truth may enter in.

026:003 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
        thee: because he trusteth in thee.

026:004 Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is
        everlasting strength:

026:005 For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city,
        he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he
        bringeth it even to the dust.

026:006 The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and
        the steps of the needy.

026:007 The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost
        weigh the path of the just.

026:008 Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for
        thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the
        remembrance of thee.

026:009 With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my
        spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy
        judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will
        learn righteousness.

026:010 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn
        righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal
        unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.

026:011 LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they
        shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea,
        the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.

026:012 LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast
        wrought all our works in us.

026:013 O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over
        us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

026:014 They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they
        shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed
        them, and made all their memory to perish.

026:015 Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased
        the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto
        all the ends of the earth.

026:016 LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a
        prayer when thy chastening was upon them.

026:017 Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her
        delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we
        been in thy sight, O LORD.

026:018 We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it
        were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance
        in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world
        fallen.

026:019 Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they
        arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is
        as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

026:020 Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
        doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment,
        until the indignation be overpast.

026:021 For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the
        inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also
        shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.

027:001 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword
        shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan
        that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in
        the sea.

027:002 In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.

027:003 I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any
        hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

027:004 Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against
        me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them
        together.

027:005 Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace
        with me; and he shall make peace with me.

027:006 He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel
        shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with
        fruit.

027:007 Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is
        he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by
        him?

027:008 In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it:
        he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.

027:009 By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and
        this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all
        the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in
        sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.

027:010 Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation
        forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf
        feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches
        thereof.

027:011 When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken
        off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people
        of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have
        mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no
        favour.

027:012 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
        beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of
        Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of
        Israel.

027:013 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet
        shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish
        in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt,
        and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.

028:001 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
        glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of
        the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!

028:002 Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a
        tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty
        waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the
        hand.

028:003 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden
        under feet:

028:004 And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat
        valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit
        before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth,
        while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.

028:005 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory,
        and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,

028:006 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment,
        and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.

028:007 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong
        drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have
        erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine,
        they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in
        vision, they stumble in judgment.

028:008 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there
        is no place clean.

028:009 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
        understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and
        drawn from the breasts.

028:010 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line
        upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:

028:011 For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to
        this people.

028:012 To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
        weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not
        hear.

028:013 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept,
        precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a
        little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall
        backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.

028:014 Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that
        rule this people which is in Jerusalem.

028:015 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and
        with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge
        shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have
        made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid
        ourselves:

028:016 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a
        foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a
        sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.

028:017 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the
        plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and
        the waters shall overflow the hiding place.

028:018 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
        agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing
        scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by
        it.

028:019 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for
        morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night:
        and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.

028:020 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
        it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in
        it.

028:021 For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be
        wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his
        strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.

028:022 Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made
        strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a
        consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.

028:023 Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.

028:024 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break
        the clods of his ground?

028:025 When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast
        abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the
        principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their
        place?

028:026 For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach
        him.

028:027 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
        neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the
        fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a
        rod.

028:028 Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing
        it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it
        with his horsemen.

028:029 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is
        wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.

029:001 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye
        year to year; let them kill sacrifices.

029:002 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and
        sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.

029:003 And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege
        against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against
        thee.

029:004 And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the
        ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy
        voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of
        the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.

029:005 Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small
        dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff
        that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.

029:006 Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and
        with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and
        the flame of devouring fire.

029:007 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
        even all that fight against her and her munition, and that
        distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.

029:008 It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold,
        he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a
        thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he
        awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite:
        so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight
        against mount Zion.

029:009 Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are
        drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong
        drink.

029:010 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep
        sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your
        rulers, the seers hath he covered.

029:011 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a
        book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned,
        saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it
        is sealed:

029:012 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying,
        Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.

029:013 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me
        with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have
        removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is
        taught by the precept of men:

029:014 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work
        among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for
        the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the
        understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.

029:015 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
        LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth
        us? and who knoweth us?

029:016 Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as
        the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it,
        He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that
        framed it, He had no understanding?

029:017 Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned
        into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be
        esteemed as a forest?

029:018 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and
        the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of
        darkness.

029:019 The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the
        poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

029:020 For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is
        consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:

029:021 That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for
        him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a
        thing of nought.

029:022 Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham,
        concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed,
        neither shall his face now wax pale.

029:023 But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the
        midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the
        Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

029:024 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding,
        and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.

030:001 Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take
        counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but
        not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:

030:002 That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my
        mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,
        and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!

030:003 Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the
        trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.

030:004 For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to
        Hanes.

030:005 They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them,
        nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

030:006 The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of
        trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion,
        the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their
        riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures
        upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit
        them.

030:007 For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:
        therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to
        sit still.

030:008 Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a
        book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:

030:009 That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children
        that will not hear the law of the LORD:

030:010 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy
        not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things,
        prophesy deceits:

030:011 Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the
        Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.

030:012 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye
        despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness,
        and stay thereon:

030:013 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to
        fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh
        suddenly at an instant.

030:014 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel
        that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there
        shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire
        from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.

030:015 For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In
        returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in
        confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.

030:016 But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall
        ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall
        they that pursue you be swift.

030:017 One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of
        five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top
        of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.

030:018 And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto
        you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy
        upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all
        they that wait for him.

030:019 For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt
        weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice
        of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.

030:020 And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the
        water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed
        into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:

030:021 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is
        the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and
        when ye turn to the left.

030:022 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
        silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou
        shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say
        unto it, Get thee hence.

030:023 Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow
        the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and
        it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle
        feed in large pastures.

030:024 The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground
        shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the
        shovel and with the fan.

030:025 And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every
        high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the
        great slaughter, when the towers fall.

030:026 Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the
        sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light
        of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach
        of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.

030:027 Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his
        anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of
        indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:

030:028 And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the
        midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of
        vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people,
        causing them to err.

030:029 Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is
        kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to
        come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of
        Israel.

030:030 And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and
        shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation
        of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with
        scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.

030:031 For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten
        down, which smote with a rod.

030:032 And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which
        the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and
        harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.

030:033 For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is
        prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is
        fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of
        brimstone, doth kindle it.

031:001 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on
        horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in
        horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto
        the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!

031:002 Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call
        back his words: but will arise against the house of the
        evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.

031:003 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses
        flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his
        hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen
        shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.

031:004 For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and
        the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of
        shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid
        of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so
        shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and
        for the hill thereof.

031:005 As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem;
        defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will
        preserve it.

031:006 Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply
        revolted.

031:007 For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver,
        and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you
        for a sin.

031:008 Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty
        man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but
        he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be
        discomfited.

031:009 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his
        princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose
        fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.

032:001 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall
        rule in judgment.

032:002 And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a
        covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as
        the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

032:003 And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears
        of them that hear shall hearken.

032:004 The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the
        tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

032:005 The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl
        said to be bountiful.

032:006 For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will
        work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error
        against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he
        will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.

032:007 The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
        devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the
        needy speaketh right.

032:008 But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things
        shall he stand.

032:009 Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless
        daughters; give ear unto my speech.

032:010 Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women:
        for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

032:011 Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless
        ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon
        your loins.

032:012 They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for
        the fruitful vine.

032:013 Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers;
        yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:

032:014 Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the
        city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for
        ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;

032:015 Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the
        wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be
        counted for a forest.

032:016 Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness
        remain in the fruitful field.

032:017 And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect
        of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.

032:018 And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in
        sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;

032:019 When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city
        shall be low in a low place.

032:020 Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth
        thither the feet of the ox and the ass.

033:001 Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and
        dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with
        thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled;
        and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they
        shall deal treacherously with thee.

033:002 O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou
        their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of
        trouble.

033:003 At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up
        of thyself the nations were scattered.

033:004 And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the
        caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run
        upon them.

033:005 The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled
        Zion with judgment and righteousness.

033:006 And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times,
        and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his
        treasure.

033:007 Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors
        of peace shall weep bitterly.

033:008 The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath
        broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth
        no man.

033:009 The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and
        hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel
        shake off their fruits.

033:010 Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now
        will I lift up myself.

033:011 Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your
        breath, as fire, shall devour you.

033:012 And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut
        up shall they be burned in the fire.

033:013 Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are
        near, acknowledge my might.

033:014 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
        hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?
        who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

033:015 He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that
        despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from
        holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of
        blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;

033:016 He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the
        munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall
        be sure.

033:017 Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold
        the land that is very far off.

033:018 Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where
        is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?

033:019 Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper
        speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that
        thou canst not understand.

033:020 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall
        see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not
        be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be
        removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.

033:021 But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad
        rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars,
        neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.

033:022 For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD
        is our king; he will save us.

033:023 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their
        mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a
        great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.

033:024 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that
        dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.

034:001 Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let
        the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all
        things that come forth of it.

034:002 For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his
        fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he
        hath delivered them to the slaughter.

034:003 Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come
        up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted
        with their blood.

034:004 And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens
        shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall
        fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a
        falling fig from the fig tree.

034:005 For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come
        down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to
        judgment.

034:006 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat
        with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the
        fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in
        Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.

034:007 And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks
        with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and
        their dust made fat with fatness.

034:008 For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of
        recompences for the controversy of Zion.

034:009 And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the
        dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become
        burning pitch.

034:010 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof
        shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall
        lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.

034:011 But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl
        also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out
        upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

034:012 They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none
        shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.

034:013 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles
        in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of
        dragons, and a court for owls.

034:014 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild
        beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow;
        the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a
        place of rest.

034:015 There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch,
        and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be
        gathered, every one with her mate.

034:016 Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these
        shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath
        commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.

034:017 And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided
        it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from
        generation to generation shall they dwell therein.

035:001 The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them;
        and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

035:002 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and
        singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the
        excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of
        the LORD, and the excellency of our God.

035:003 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

035:004 Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:
        behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a
        recompence; he will come and save you.

035:005 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of
        the deaf shall be unstopped.

035:006 Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
        dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and
        streams in the desert.

035:007 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty
        land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where
        each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.

035:008 And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be
        called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over
        it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though
        fools, shall not err therein.

035:009 No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up
        thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall
        walk there:

035:010 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion
        with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall
        obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee
        away.

036:001 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
        that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the
        defenced cities of Judah, and took them.

036:002 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to
        Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood
        by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the
        fuller's field.

036:003 Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was
        over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son,
        the recorder.

036:004 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
        saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is
        this wherein thou trustest?

036:005 I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have
        counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust,
        that thou rebellest against me?

036:006 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt;
        whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce
        it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.

036:007 But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not
        he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken
        away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship
        before this altar?

036:008 Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king
        of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou
        be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

036:009 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
        least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for
        chariots and for horsemen?

036:010 And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to
        destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land,
        and destroy it.

036:011 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I
        pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we
        understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in
        the ears of the people that are on the wall.

036:012 But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and
        to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men
        that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and
        drink their own piss with you?

036:013 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
        language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the
        king of Assyria.

036:014 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he
        shall not be able to deliver you.

036:015 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
        LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered
        into the hand of the king of Assyria.

036:016 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
        Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me:
        and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig
        tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;

036:017 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a
        land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

036:018 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will
        deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his
        land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

036:019 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of
        Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

036:020 Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have
        delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should
        deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

036:021 But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for
        the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

036:022 Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the
        household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph,
        the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told
        him the words of Rabshakeh.

037:001 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
        his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into
        the house of the LORD.

037:002 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna
        the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with
        sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

037:003 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day
        of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children
        are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring
        forth.

037:004 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
        whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the
        living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God
        hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that
        is left.

037:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

037:006 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master,
        Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast
        heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have
        blasphemed me.

037:007 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
        rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to
        fall by the sword in his own land.

037:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
        against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from
        Lachish.

037:009 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is
        come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he
        sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

037:010 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not
        thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying,
        Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of
        Assyria.

037:011 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
        all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be
        delivered?

037:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
        have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the
        children of Eden which were in Telassar?

037:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the
        king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

037:014 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the
        messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house
        of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

037:015 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,

037:016 O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the
        cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the
        kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.

037:017 Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD,
        and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath
        sent to reproach the living God.

037:018 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the
        nations, and their countries,

037:019 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods,
        but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they
        have destroyed them.

037:020 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all
        the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD,
        even thou only.

037:021 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus
        saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me
        against Sennacherib king of Assyria:

037:022 This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him;
        The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and
        laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken
        her head at thee.

037:023 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom
        hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
        even against the Holy One of Israel.

037:024 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said,
        By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of
        the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down
        the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and
        I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of
        his Carmel.

037:025 I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet
        have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.

037:026 Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of
        ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to
        pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into
        ruinous heaps.

037:027 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
        dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field,
        and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as
        corn blasted before it be grown up.

037:028 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
        and thy rage against me.

037:029 Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into
        mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my
        bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by
        which thou camest.

037:030 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year
        such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which
        springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap,
        and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.

037:031 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
        again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:

037:032 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
        escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall
        do this.

037:033 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,
        He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there,
        nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.

037:034 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and
        shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

037:035 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and
        for my servant David's sake.

037:036 Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp
        of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand:
        and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were
        all dead corpses.

037:037 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and
        returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

037:038 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
        Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote
        him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia:
        and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

038:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the
        prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus
        saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die,
        and not live.

038:002 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto
        the LORD,

038:003 And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have
        walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have
        done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

038:004 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,

038:005 Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David
        thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears:
        behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.

038:006 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the
        king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.

038:007 And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the
        LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;

038:008 Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is
        gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So
        the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone
        down.

038:009 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick,
        and was recovered of his sickness:

038:010 I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates
        of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.

038:011 I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land
        of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants
        of the world.

038:012 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's
        tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off
        with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an
        end of me.

038:013 I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all
        my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

038:014 Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a
        dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am
        oppressed; undertake for me.

038:015 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself
        hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness
        of my soul.

038:016 O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is
        the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to
        live.

038:017 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in
        love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for
        thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.

038:018 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate
        thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy
        truth.

038:019 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this
        day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

038:020 The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs
        to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the
        house of the LORD.

038:021 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it
        for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.

038:022 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to
        the house of the LORD?

039:001 At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
        Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had
        heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.

039:002 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of
        his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices,
        and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour,
        and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in
        his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them
        not.

039:003 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
        him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?
        And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me,
        even from Babylon.

039:004 Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
        answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is
        nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.

039:005 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of
        hosts:

039:006 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and
        that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day,
        shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the
        LORD.

039:007 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
        beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
        palace of the king of Babylon.

039:008 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
        which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be
        peace and truth in my days.

040:001 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.

040:002 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her
        warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for
        she hath received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.

040:003 The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
        way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our
        God.

040:004 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill
        shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and
        the rough places plain:

040:005 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh
        shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken
        it.

040:006 The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh
        is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of
        the field:

040:007 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of
        the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.

040:008 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our
        God shall stand for ever.

040:009 O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high
        mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy
        voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the
        cities of Judah, Behold your God!

040:010 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm
        shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his
        work before him.

040:011 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the
        lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall
        gently lead those that are with young.

040:012 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and
        meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of
        the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
        and the hills in a balance?

040:013 Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his
        counsellor hath taught him?

040:014 With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught
        him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and
        shewed to him the way of understanding?

040:015 Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted
        as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the
        isles as a very little thing.

040:016 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof
        sufficient for a burnt offering.

040:017 All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to
        him less than nothing, and vanity.

040:018 To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye
        compare unto him?

040:019 The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith
        spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.

040:020 He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a
        tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman
        to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.

040:021 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told
        you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the
        foundations of the earth?

040:022 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the
        inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out
        the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to
        dwell in:

040:023 That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of
        the earth as vanity.

040:024 Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown:
        yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he
        shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the
        whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.

040:025 To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the
        Holy One.

040:026 Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these
        things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth
        them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he
        is strong in power; not one faileth.

040:027 Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is
        hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?

040:028 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting
        God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth
        not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his
        understanding.

040:029 He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might
        he increaseth strength.

040:030 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men
        shall utterly fall:

040:031 But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength;
        they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and
        not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.

041:001 Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew
        their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let
        us come near together to judgment.

041:002 Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to
        his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over
        kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven
        stubble to his bow.

041:003 He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he
        had not gone with his feet.

041:004 Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the
        beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.

041:005 The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were
        afraid, drew near, and came.

041:006 They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his
        brother, Be of good courage.

041:007 So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that
        smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It
        is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that
        it should not be moved.

041:008 But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,
        the seed of Abraham my friend.

041:009 Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called
        thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art
        my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.

041:010 Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am
        thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I
        will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.

041:011 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be
        ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they
        that strive with thee shall perish.

041:012 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that
        contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as
        nothing, and as a thing of nought.

041:013 For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto
        thee, Fear not; I will help thee.

041:014 Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help
        thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of
        Israel.

041:015 Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument
        having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them
        small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.

041:016 Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and
        the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in
        the LORD, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.

041:017 When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and
        their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I
        the God of Israel will not forsake them.

041:018 I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst
        of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
        and the dry land springs of water.

041:019 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree,
        and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the
        fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:

041:020 That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand
        together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the
        Holy One of Israel hath created it.

041:021 Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong
        reasons, saith the King of Jacob.

041:022 Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let
        them shew the former things, what they be, that we may
        consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us
        things for to come.

041:023 Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know
        that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be
        dismayed, and behold it together.

041:024 Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an
        abomination is he that chooseth you.

041:025 I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from
        the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall
        come upon princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth
        clay.

041:026 Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and
        beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is
        none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea,
        there is none that heareth your words.

041:027 The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will
        give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.

041:028 For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there
        was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a
        word.

041:029 Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their
        molten images are wind and confusion.

042:001 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
        delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring
        forth judgment to the Gentiles.

042:002 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard
        in the street.

042:003 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall
        he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

042:004 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set
        judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.

042:005 Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and
        stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that
        which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people
        upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:

042:006 I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold
        thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant
        of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;

042:007 To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
        prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

042:008 I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give
        to another, neither my praise to graven images.

042:009 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do
        I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

042:010 Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of
        the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is
        therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.

042:011 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,
        the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of
        the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

042:012 Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in
        the islands.

042:013 The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up
        jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall
        prevail against his enemies.

042:014 I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and
        refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I
        will destroy and devour at once.

042:015 I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their
        herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up
        the pools.

042:016 And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will
        lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make
        darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These
        things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.

042:017 They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that
        trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are
        our gods.

042:018 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

042:019 Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I
        sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the
        LORD's servant?

042:020 Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears,
        but he heareth not.

042:021 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will
        magnify the law, and make it honourable.

042:022 But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them
        snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are
        for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith,
        Restore.

042:023 Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear
        for the time to come?

042:024 Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not
        the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not
        walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.

042:025 Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and
        the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round
        about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not
        to heart.

043:001 But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he
        that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed
        thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.

043:002 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
        through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou
        walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither
        shall the flame kindle upon thee.

043:003 For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy
        Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for
        thee.

043:004 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been
        honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men
        for thee, and people for thy life.

043:005 Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the
        east, and gather thee from the west;

043:006 I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not
        back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends
        of the earth;

043:007 Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created
        him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

043:008 Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that
        have ears.

043:009 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people
        be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us
        former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they
        may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.

043:010 Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I
        have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand
        that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall
        there be after me.

043:011 I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.

043:012 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there
        was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses,
        saith the LORD, that I am God.

043:013 Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can
        deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

043:014 Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;
        For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down
        all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the
        ships.

043:015 I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your
        King.

043:016 Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path
        in the mighty waters;

043:017 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the
        power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they
        are extinct, they are quenched as tow.

043:018 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things
        of old.

043:019 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth;
        shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the
        wilderness, and rivers in the desert.

043:020 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the
        owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in
        the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.

043:021 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
        praise.

043:022 But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been
        weary of me, O Israel.

043:023 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt
        offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices.
        I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied
        thee with incense.

043:024 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast
        thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast
        made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with
        thine iniquities.

043:025 I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine
        own sake, and will not remember thy sins.

043:026 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou,
        that thou mayest be justified.

043:027 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have
        transgressed against me.

043:028 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and
        have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

044:001 Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have
        chosen:

044:002 Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the
        womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and
        thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.

044:003 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods
        upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and
        my blessing upon thine offspring:

044:004 And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the
        water courses.

044:005 One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself
        by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his
        hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.

044:006 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the
        LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside
        me there is no God.

044:007 And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in
        order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the
        things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto
        them.

044:008 Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that
        time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there
        a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.

044:009 They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and
        their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their
        own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be
        ashamed.

044:010 Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is
        profitable for nothing?

044:011 Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen,
        they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them
        stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed
        together.

044:012 The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and
        fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength
        of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he
        drinketh no water, and is faint.

044:013 The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with
        a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with
        the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man,
        according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the
        house.

044:014 He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak,
        which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the
        forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.

044:015 Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof,
        and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea,
        he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven
        image, and falleth down thereto.

044:016 He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he
        eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he
        warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the
        fire:

044:017 And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven
        image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and
        prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.

044:018 They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their
        eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot
        understand.

044:019 And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge
        nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the
        fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I
        have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue
        thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a
        tree?

044:020 He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside,
        that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie
        in my right hand?

044:021 Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I
        have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt
        not be forgotten of me.

044:022 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and,
        as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed
        thee.

044:023 Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower
        parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O
        forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed
        Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.

044:024 Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee
        from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that
        stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the
        earth by myself;

044:025 That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners
        mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their
        knowledge foolish;

044:026 That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the
        counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt
        be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built,
        and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:

044:027 That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:

044:028 That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all
        my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built;
        and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

045:001 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right
        hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will
        loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved
        gates; and the gates shall not be shut;

045:002 I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I
        will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the
        bars of iron:

045:003 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden
        riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the
        LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.

045:004 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have
        even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though
        thou hast not known me.

045:005 I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside
        me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:

045:006 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the
        west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there
        is none else.

045:007 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and
        create evil: I the LORD do all these things.

045:008 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down
        righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth
        salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the
        LORD have created it.

045:009 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd
        strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to
        him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath
        no hands?

045:010 Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou?
        or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?

045:011 Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker,
        Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning
        the work of my hands command ye me.

045:012 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my
        hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have
        I commanded.

045:013 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all
        his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my
        captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.

045:014 Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of
        Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over
        unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after
        thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down
        unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying,
        Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no
        God.

045:015 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel,
        the Saviour.

045:016 They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they
        shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.

045:017 But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting
        salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world
        without end.

045:018 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself
        that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he
        created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the
        LORD; and there is none else.

045:019 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I
        said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the
        LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.

045:020 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are
        escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the
        wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot
        save.

045:021 Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel
        together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath
        told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no
        God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none
        beside me.

045:022 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for
        I am God, and there is none else.

045:023 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in
        righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee
        shall bow, every tongue shall swear.

045:024 Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and
        strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are
        incensed against him shall be ashamed.

045:025 In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and
        shall glory.

046:001 Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the
        beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden;
        they are a burden to the weary beast.

046:002 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the
        burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.

046:003 Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the
        house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which
        are carried from the womb:

046:004 And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will
        I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry,
        and will deliver you.

046:005 To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me,
        that we may be like?

046:006 They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the
        balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they
        fall down, yea, they worship.

046:007 They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him
        in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not
        remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer,
        nor save him out of his trouble.

046:008 Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to
        mind, O ye transgressors.

046:009 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is
        none else; I am God, and there is none like me,

046:010 Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times
        the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall
        stand, and I will do all my pleasure:

046:011 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth
        my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will
        also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.

046:012 Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from
        righteousness:

046:013 I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my
        salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion
        for Israel my glory.

047:001 Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon,
        sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the
        Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and
        delicate.

047:002 Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make
        bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.

047:003 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be
        seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a
        man.

047:004 As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy
        One of Israel.

047:005 Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the
        Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of
        kingdoms.

047:006 I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance,
        and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy;
        upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.

047:007 And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou
        didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst
        remember the latter end of it.

047:008 Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures,
        that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am,
        and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither
        shall I know the loss of children:

047:009 But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one
        day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon
        thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries,
        and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.

047:010 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None
        seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted
        thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else
        beside me.

047:011 Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from
        whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou
        shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come
        upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.

047:012 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of
        thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if
        so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest
        prevail.

047:013 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the
        astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators,
        stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon
        thee.

047:014 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them;
        they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame:
        there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before
        it.

047:015 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured,
        even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every
        one to his quarter; none shall save thee.

048:001 Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name
        of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah,
        which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the
        God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.

048:002 For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves
        upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.

048:003 I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they
        went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them
        suddenly, and they came to pass.

048:004 Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an
        iron sinew, and thy brow brass;

048:005 I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it
        came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine
        idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image,
        hath commanded them.

048:006 Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I
        have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden
        things, and thou didst not know them.

048:007 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before
        the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say,
        Behold, I knew them.

048:008 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that
        time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou
        wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a
        transgressor from the womb.

048:009 For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise
        will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.

048:010 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have
        chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.

048:011 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for
        how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory
        unto another.

048:012 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am
        the first, I also am the last.

048:013 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my
        right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them,
        they stand up together.

048:014 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath
        declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his
        pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.

048:015 I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought
        him, and he shall make his way prosperous.

048:016 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in
        secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am
        I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

048:017 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I
        am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which
        leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.

048:018 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy
        peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of
        the sea:

048:019 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy
        bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been
        cut off nor destroyed from before me.

048:020 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a
        voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the
        end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant
        Jacob.

048:021 And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he
        caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave
        the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

048:022 There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.

049:001 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far;
        The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my
        mother hath he made mention of my name.

049:002 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of
        his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his
        quiver hath he hid me;

049:003 And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I
        will be glorified.

049:004 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength
        for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the
        LORD, and my work with my God.

049:005 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his
        servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not
        gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and
        my God shall be my strength.

049:006 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
        servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the
        preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the
        Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the
        earth.

049:007 Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,
        to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth,
        to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes
        also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and
        the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.

049:008 Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee,
        and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will
        preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to
        establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate
        heritages;

049:009 That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that
        are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways,
        and their pastures shall be in all high places.

049:010 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor
        sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead
        them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.

049:011 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall
        be exalted.

049:012 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the
        north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.

049:013 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into
        singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people,
        and will have mercy upon his afflicted.

049:014 But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
        forgotten me.

049:015 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
        compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet
        will I not forget thee.

049:016 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy
        walls are continually before me.

049:017 Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that
        made thee waste shall go forth of thee.

049:018 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather
        themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the
        LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an
        ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.

049:019 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy
        destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the
        inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far
        away.

049:020 The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the
        other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait
        for me: give place to me that I may dwell.

049:021 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me
        these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a
        captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up
        these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?

049:022 Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to
        the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they
        shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be
        carried upon their shoulders.

049:023 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy
        nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face
        toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou
        shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed
        that wait for me.

049:024 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
        delivered?

049:025 But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall
        be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be
        delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with
        thee, and I will save thy children.

049:026 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh;
        and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet
        wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour
        and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

050:001 Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's
        divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is
        it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have
        ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother
        put away.

050:002 Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was
        there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it
        cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my
        rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their
        fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for
        thirst.

050:003 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth
        their covering.

050:004 The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I
        should know how to speak a word in season to him that is
        weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to
        hear as the learned.

050:005 The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
        neither turned away back.

050:006 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that
        plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and
        spitting.

050:007 For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be
        confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I
        know that I shall not be ashamed.

050:008 He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let
        us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to
        me.

050:009 Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall
        condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth
        shall eat them up.

050:010 Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice
        of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light?
        let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.

050:011 Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves
        about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the
        sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand;
        ye shall lie down in sorrow.

051:001 Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that
        seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to
        the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.

051:002 Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you:
        for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.

051:003 For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste
        places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her
        desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be
        found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.

051:004 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation:
        for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment
        to rest for a light of the people.

051:005 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine
        arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and
        on mine arm shall they trust.

051:006 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth
        beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the
        earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell
        therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be
        for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

051:007 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in
        whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men,
        neither be ye afraid of their revilings.

051:008 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm
        shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for
        ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.

051:009 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in
        the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it
        that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?

051:010 Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the
        great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the
        ransomed to pass over?

051:011 Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with
        singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their
        head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and
        mourning shall flee away.

051:012 I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou
        shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of
        man which shall be made as grass;

051:013 And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth
        the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast
        feared continually every day because of the fury of the
        oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the
        fury of the oppressor?

051:014 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he
        should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.

051:015 But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves
        roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.

051:016 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee
        in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and
        lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art
        my people.

051:017 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the
        hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the
        dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.

051:018 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath
        brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the
        hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.

051:019 These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for
        thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the
        sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?

051:020 Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the
        streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of
        the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.

051:021 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not
        with wine:

051:022 Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the
        cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand
        the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury;
        thou shalt no more drink it again:

051:023 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee;
        which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over:
        and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street,
        to them that went over.

052:001 Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy
        beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth
        there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the
        unclean.

052:002 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem:
        loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter
        of Zion.

052:003 For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought;
        and ye shall be redeemed without money.

052:004 For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime
        into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them
        without cause.

052:005 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my
        people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make
        them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every
        day is blasphemed.

052:006 Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall
        know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is
        I.

052:007 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
        bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth
        good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith
        unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!

052:008 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together
        shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD
        shall bring again Zion.

052:009 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of
        Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath
        redeemed Jerusalem.

052:010 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
        nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation
        of our God.

052:011 Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean
        thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear
        the vessels of the LORD.

052:012 For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the
        LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your
        rereward.

052:013 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted
        and extolled, and be very high.

052:014 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more
        than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:

052:015 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their
        mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall
        they see; and that which they had not heard shall they
        consider.

053:001 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the
        LORD revealed?

053:002 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a
        root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and
        when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should
        desire him.

053:003 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
        acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from
        him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.

053:004 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet
        we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

053:005 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for
        our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him;
        and with his stripes we are healed.

053:006 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one
        to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of
        us all.

053:007 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
        mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
        sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his
        mouth.

053:008 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall
        declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of
        the living: for the transgression of my people was he
        stricken.

053:009 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in
        his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any
        deceit in his mouth.

053:010 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to
        grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he
        shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the
        pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.

053:011 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be
        satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify
        many; for he shall bear their iniquities.

053:012 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he
        shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured
        out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the
        transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made
        intercession for the transgressors.

054:001 Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into
        singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with
        child: for more are the children of the desolate than the
        children of the married wife, saith the LORD.

054:002 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the
        curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords,
        and strengthen thy stakes;

054:003 For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left;
        and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate
        cities to be inhabited.

054:004 Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou
        confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt
        forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the
        reproach of thy widowhood any more.

054:005 For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name;
        and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole
        earth shall he be called.

054:006 For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved
        in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith
        thy God.

054:007 For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great
        mercies will I gather thee.

054:008 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but
        with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the
        LORD thy Redeemer.

054:009 For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn
        that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so
        have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke
        thee.

054:010 For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but
        my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the
        covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath
        mercy on thee.

054:011 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted,
        behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy
        foundations with sapphires.

054:012 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of
        carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.

054:013 And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great
        shall be the peace of thy children.

054:014 In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far
        from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for
        it shall not come near thee.

054:015 Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me:
        whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for
        thy sake.

054:016 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the
        fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and
        I have created the waster to destroy.

054:017 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every
        tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt
        condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and
        their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.

055:001 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he
        that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine
        and milk without money and without price.

055:002 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and
        your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently
        unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul
        delight itself in fatness.

055:003 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall
        live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even
        the sure mercies of David.

055:004 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader
        and commander to the people.

055:005 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and
        nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the
        LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath
        glorified thee.

055:006 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while
        he is near:

055:007 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
        thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have
        mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

055:008 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
        my ways, saith the LORD.

055:009 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
        higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

055:010 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and
        returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it
        bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and
        bread to the eater:

055:011 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall
        not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I
        please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.

055:012 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the
        mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into
        singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their
        hands.

055:013 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead
        of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to
        the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be
        cut off.

056:001 Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my
        salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be
        revealed.

056:002 Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that
        layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,
        and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.

056:003 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself
        to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me
        from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a
        dry tree.

056:004 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my
        sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold
        of my covenant;

056:005 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a
        place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will
        give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.

056:006 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the
        LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be
        his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from
        polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;

056:007 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them
        joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their
        sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house
        shall be called an house of prayer for all people.

056:008 The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith,
        Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are
        gathered unto him.

056:009 All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts
        in the forest.

056:010 His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all
        dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to
        slumber.

056:011 Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and
        they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to
        their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.

056:012 Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill
        ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this
        day, and much more abundant.

057:001 The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and
        merciful men are taken away, none considering that the
        righteous is taken away from the evil to come.

057:002 He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each
        one walking in his uprightness.

057:003 But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of
        the adulterer and the whore.

057:004 Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a
        wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of
        transgression, a seed of falsehood.

057:005 Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree,
        slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the
        rocks?

057:006 Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they,
        they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink
        offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive
        comfort in these?

057:007 Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even
        thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.

057:008 Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy
        remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than
        me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee
        a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest
        it.

057:009 And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase
        thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst
        debase thyself even unto hell.

057:010 Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou
        not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand;
        therefore thou wast not grieved.

057:011 And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast
        lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart?
        have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?

057:012 I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they
        shall not profit thee.

057:013 When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind
        shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that
        putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall
        inherit my holy mountain;

057:014 And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take
        up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.

057:015 For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth
        eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy
        place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit,
        to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of
        the contrite ones.

057:016 For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always
        wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls
        which I have made.

057:017 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote
        him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the
        way of his heart.

057:018 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also,
        and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

057:019 I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is
        far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will
        heal him.

057:020 But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,
        whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

057:021 There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.

058:001 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and
        shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob
        their sins.

058:002 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a
        nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance
        of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they
        take delight in approaching to God.

058:003 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?
        wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no
        knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure,
        and exact all your labours.

058:004 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the
        fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to
        make your voice to be heard on high.

058:005 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to
        afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and
        to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a
        fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?

058:006 Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of
        wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the
        oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?

058:007 Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring
        the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the
        naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself
        from thine own flesh?

058:008 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine
        health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness
        shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy
        rereward.

058:009 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt
        cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the
        midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and
        speaking vanity;

058:010 And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the
        afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and
        thy darkness be as the noon day:

058:011 And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy
        soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be
        like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose
        waters fail not.

058:012 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste
        places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many
        generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the
        breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.

058:013 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
        pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the
        holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing
        thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking
        thine own words:

058:014 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause
        thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee
        with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the
        LORD hath spoken it.

059:001 Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;
        neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:

059:002 But your iniquities have separated between you and your God,
        and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not
        hear.

059:003 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with
        iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath
        muttered perverseness.

059:004 None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they
        trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and
        bring forth iniquity.

059:005 They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he
        that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed
        breaketh out into a viper.

059:006 Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
        themselves with their works: their works are works of
        iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.

059:007 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent
        blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and
        destruction are in their paths.

059:008 The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in
        their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever
        goeth therein shall not know peace.

059:009 Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice
        overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for
        brightness, but we walk in darkness.

059:010 We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we
        had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in
        desolate places as dead men.

059:011 We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for
        judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off
        from us.

059:012 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our
        sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us;
        and as for our iniquities, we know them;

059:013 In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing
        away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving
        and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.

059:014 And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth
        afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot
        enter.

059:015 Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh
        himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him
        that there was no judgment.

059:016 And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was
        no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him;
        and his righteousness, it sustained him.

059:017 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of
        salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of
        vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.

059:018 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to
        his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he
        will repay recompence.

059:019 So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his
        glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in
        like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard
        against him.

059:020 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn
        from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.

059:021 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My
        spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy
        mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth
        of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith
        the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.

060:001 Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD
        is risen upon thee.

060:002 For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
        darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and
        his glory shall be seen upon thee.

060:003 And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the
        brightness of thy rising.

060:004 Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather
        themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come
        from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.

060:005 Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall
        fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall
        be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come
        unto thee.

060:006 The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of
        Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall
        bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises
        of the LORD.

060:007 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee,
        the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come
        up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house
        of my glory.

060:008 Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their
        windows?

060:009 Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish
        first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold
        with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy
        One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.

060:010 And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their
        kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee,
        but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.

060:011 Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not
        be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces
        of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.

060:012 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall
        perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.

060:013 The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the
        pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my
        sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.

060:014 The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending
        unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow
        themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call
        thee; The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of
        Israel.

060:015 Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated, so that no man went
        through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of
        many generations.

060:016 Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck
        the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am
        thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

060:017 For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver,
        and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy
        officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.

060:018 Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor
        destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls
        Salvation, and thy gates Praise.

060:019 The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for
        brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD
        shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy
        glory.

060:020 Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw
        itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the
        days of thy mourning shall be ended.

060:021 Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the
        land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my
        hands, that I may be glorified.

060:022 A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong
        nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.

061:001 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath
        anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent
        me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the
        captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are
        bound;

061:002 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of
        vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;

061:003 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them
        beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
        praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called
        trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he
        might be glorified.

061:004 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the
        former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities,
        the desolations of many generations.

061:005 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons
        of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

061:006 But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call
        you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the
        Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.

061:007 For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they
        shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they
        shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.

061:008 For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt
        offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will
        make an everlasting covenant with them.

061:009 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their
        offspring among the people: all that see them shall
        acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath
        blessed.

061:010 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in
        my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation,
        he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a
        bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride
        adorneth herself with her jewels.

061:011 For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden
        causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the
        Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth
        before all the nations.

062:001 For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's
        sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth
        as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that
        burneth.

062:002 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings
        thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the
        mouth of the LORD shall name.

062:003 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD,
        and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.

062:004 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land
        any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called
        Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in
        thee, and thy land shall be married.

062:005 For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry
        thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall
        thy God rejoice over thee.

062:006 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall
        never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of
        the LORD, keep not silence,

062:007 And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make
        Jerusalem a praise in the earth.

062:008 The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his
        strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for
        thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink
        thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:

062:009 But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the
        LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in
        the courts of my holiness.

062:010 Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the
        people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones;
        lift up a standard for the people.

062:011 Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world,
        Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh;
        behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.

062:012 And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the
        LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not
        forsaken.

063:001 Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
        Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in
        the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness,
        mighty to save.

063:002 Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like
        him that treadeth in the winefat?

063:003 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there
        was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and
        trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled
        upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.

063:004 For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my
        redeemed is come.

063:005 And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that
        there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought
        salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.

063:006 And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them
        drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the
        earth.

063:007 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the
        praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath
        bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of
        Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his
        mercies, and according to the multitude of his
        lovingkindnesses.

063:008 For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not
        lie: so he was their Saviour.

063:009 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his
        presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed
        them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.

063:010 But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was
        turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.

063:011 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people,
        saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with
        the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy
        Spirit within him?

063:012 That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious
        arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an
        everlasting name?

063:013 That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness,
        that they should not stumble?

063:014 As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD
        caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make
        thyself a glorious name.

063:015 Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy
        holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength,
        the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are
        they restrained?

063:016 Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of
        us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our
        father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.

063:017 O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and
        hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants'
        sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.

063:018 The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little
        while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.

063:019 We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not
        called by thy name.

064:001 Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest
        come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,

064:002 As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters
        to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the
        nations may tremble at thy presence!

064:003 When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou
        camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.

064:004 For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor
        perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside
        thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.

064:005 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness,
        those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth;
        for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be
        saved.

064:006 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our
        righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a
        leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

064:007 And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up
        himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from
        us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.

064:008 But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and
        thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.

064:009 Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for
        ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.

064:010 Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness,
        Jerusalem a desolation.

064:011 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised
        thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are
        laid waste.

064:012 Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou
        hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?

065:001 I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them
        that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a
        nation that was not called by my name.

065:002 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious
        people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their
        own thoughts;

065:003 A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face;
        that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars
        of brick;

065:004 Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments,
        which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in
        their vessels;

065:005 Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am
        holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that
        burneth all the day.

065:006 Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but
        will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,

065:007 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,
        saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains,
        and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure
        their former work into their bosom.

065:008 Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster,
        and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so
        will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them
        all.

065:009 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah
        an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it,
        and my servants shall dwell there.

065:010 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor
        a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have
        sought me.

065:011 But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy
        mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that
        furnish the drink offering unto that number.

065:012 Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow
        down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not
        answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before
        mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.

065:013 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall
        eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink,
        but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice,
        but ye shall be ashamed:

065:014 Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall
        cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of
        spirit.

065:015 And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for
        the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another
        name:

065:016 That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself
        in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall
        swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are
        forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.

065:017 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
        former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.

065:018 But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create:
        for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a
        joy.

065:019 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the
        voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice
        of crying.

065:020 There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old
        man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an
        hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old
        shall be accursed.

065:021 And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall
        plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

065:022 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not
        plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days
        of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of
        their hands.

065:023 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble;
        for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their
        offspring with them.

065:024 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will
        answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

065:025 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
        eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's
        meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,
        saith the LORD.

066:001 Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is
        my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and
        where is the place of my rest?

066:002 For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things
        have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even
        to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at
        my word.

066:003 He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that
        sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that
        offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that
        burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have
        chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their
        abominations.

066:004 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears
        upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I
        spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes,
        and chose that in which I delighted not.

066:005 Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your
        brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake,
        said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your
        joy, and they shall be ashamed.

066:006 A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a
        voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.

066:007 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came,
        she was delivered of a man child.

066:008 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall
        the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation
        be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought
        forth her children.

066:009 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?
        saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the
        womb? saith thy God.

066:010 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that
        love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:

066:011 That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her
        consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the
        abundance of her glory.

066:012 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her
        like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing
        stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides,
        and be dandled upon her knees.

066:013 As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and
        ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.

066:014 And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones
        shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be
        known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his
        enemies.

066:015 For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his
        chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and
        his rebuke with flames of fire.

066:016 For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all
        flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.

066:017 They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the
        gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh,
        and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed
        together, saith the LORD.

066:018 For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that
        I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come,
        and see my glory.

066:019 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that
        escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud,
        that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off,
        that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and
        they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.

066:020 And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto
        the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and
        in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy
        mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel
        bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the
        LORD.

066:021 And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites,
        saith the LORD.

066:022 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
        shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and
        your name remain.

066:023 And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another,
        and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to
        worship before me, saith the LORD.

066:024 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men
        that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not
        die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be
        an abhorring unto all flesh.

Book 24	Jeremiah

001:001 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that
        were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:

001:002 To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the
        son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his
        reign.

001:003 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
        of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the
        son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of
        Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.

001:004 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

001:005 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou
        camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained
        thee a prophet unto the nations.

001:006 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a
        child.

001:007 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou
        shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I
        command thee thou shalt speak.

001:008 Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver
        thee, saith the LORD.

001:009 Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And
        the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy
        mouth.

001:010 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the
        kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and
        to throw down, to build, and to plant.

001:011 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah,
        what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.

001:012 Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will
        hasten my word to perform it.

001:013 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,
        What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the
        face thereof is toward the north.

001:014 Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall
        break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.

001:015 For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the
        north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set
        every one his throne at the entering of the gates of
        Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and
        against all the cities of Judah.

001:016 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their
        wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
        other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.

001:017 Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto
        them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces,
        lest I confound thee before them.

001:018 For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an
        iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against
        the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the
        priests thereof, and against the people of the land.

001:019 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail
        against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver
        thee.

002:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

002:002 Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the
        LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of
        thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness,
        in a land that was not sown.

002:003 Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his
        increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come
        upon them, saith the LORD.

002:004 Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the
        families of the house of Israel:

002:005 Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in
        me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after
        vanity, and are become vain?

002:006 Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of
        the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through
        a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and
        of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed
        through, and where no man dwelt?

002:007 And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit
        thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye
        defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.

002:008 The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle
        the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me,
        and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things
        that do not profit.

002:009 Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with
        your children's children will I plead.

002:010 For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto
        Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a
        thing.

002:011 Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but
        my people have changed their glory for that which doth not
        profit.

002:012 Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid,
        be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.

002:013 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me
        the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns,
        broken cisterns, that can hold no water.

002:014 Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he
        spoiled?

002:015 The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his
        land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.

002:016 Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown
        of thy head.

002:017 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast
        forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?

002:018 And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the
        waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of
        Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?

002:019 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings
        shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil
        thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God,
        and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

002:020 For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands;
        and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high
        hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the
        harlot.

002:021 Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how
        then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange
        vine unto me?

002:022 For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap,
        yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.

002:023 How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after
        Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done:
        thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;

002:024 A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind
        at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all
        they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month
        they shall find her.

002:025 Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from
        thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have
        loved strangers, and after them will I go.

002:026 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of
        Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their
        priests, and their prophets.

002:027 Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou
        hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto
        me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they
        will say, Arise, and save us.

002:028 But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them
        arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for
        according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.

002:029 Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed
        against me, saith the LORD.

002:030 In vain have I smitten your children; they received no
        correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a
        destroying lion.

002:031 O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a
        wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my
        people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?

002:032 Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my
        people have forgotten me days without number.

002:033 Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou
        also taught the wicked ones thy ways.

002:034 Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor
        innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all
        these.

002:035 Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall
        turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou
        sayest, I have not sinned.

002:036 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also
        shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.

002:037 Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine
        head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou
        shalt not prosper in them.

003:001 They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and
        become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall
        not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the
        harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the
        LORD.

003:002 Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou
        hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them,
        as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the
        land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.

003:003 Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath
        been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou
        refusedst to be ashamed.

003:004 Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art
        the guide of my youth?

003:005 Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the
        end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou
        couldest.

003:006 The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king,
        Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is
        gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree,
        and there hath played the harlot.

003:007 And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto
        me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw
        it.

003:008 And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel
        committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of
        divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went
        and played the harlot also.

003:009 And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom,
        that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones
        and with stocks.

003:010 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not
        turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the
        LORD.

003:011 And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath
        justified herself more than treacherous Judah.

003:012 Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return,
        thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause
        mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the
        LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.

003:013 Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
        against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the
        strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my
        voice, saith the LORD.

003:014 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married
        unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a
        family, and I will bring you to Zion:

003:015 And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which
        shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.

003:016 And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased
        in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no
        more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it
        come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall
        they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.

003:017 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD;
        and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of
        the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after
        the imagination of their evil heart.

003:018 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of
        Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the
        north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto
        your fathers.

003:019 But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give
        thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of
        nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt
        not turn away from me.

003:020 Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so
        have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith
        the LORD.

003:021 A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and
        supplications of the children of Israel: for they have
        perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their
        God.

003:022 Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your
        backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD
        our God.

003:023 Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from
        the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the
        salvation of Israel.

003:024 For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our
        youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their
        daughters.

003:025 We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for
        we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers,
        from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the
        voice of the LORD our God.

004:001 If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me:
        and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight,
        then shalt thou not remove.

004:002 And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment,
        and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves
        in him, and in him shall they glory.

004:003 For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem,
        Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.

004:004 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins
        of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem:
        lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can
        quench it, because of the evil of your doings.

004:005 Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow
        ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say,
        Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.

004:006 Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will
        bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.

004:007 The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the
        Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to
        make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste,
        without an inhabitant.

004:008 For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the
        fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.

004:009 And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that
        the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the
        princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets
        shall wonder.

004:010 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived
        this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace;
        whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.

004:011 At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem,
        A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the
        daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,

004:012 Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now
        also will I give sentence against them.

004:013 Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be
        as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto
        us! for we are spoiled.

004:014 O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou
        mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within
        thee?

004:015 For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from
        mount Ephraim.

004:016 Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against
        Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out
        their voice against the cities of Judah.

004:017 As keepers of a field, are they against her round about;
        because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.

004:018 Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee;
        this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it
        reacheth unto thine heart.

004:019 My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart
        maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou
        hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of
        war.

004:020 Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is
        spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a
        moment.

004:021 How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the
        trumpet?

004:022 For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are
        sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are
        wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.

004:023 I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void;
        and the heavens, and they had no light.

004:024 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the
        hills moved lightly.

004:025 I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the
        heavens were fled.

004:026 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and
        all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the
        LORD, and by his fierce anger.

004:027 For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate;
        yet will I not make a full end.

004:028 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be
        black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will
        not repent, neither will I turn back from it.

004:029 The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and
        bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the
        rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell
        therein.

004:030 And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou
        clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with
        ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting,
        in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise
        thee, they will seek thy life.

004:031 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the
        anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the
        voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that
        spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is
        wearied because of murderers.

005:001 Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see
        now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can
        find a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that
        seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.

005:002 And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear
        falsely.

005:003 O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken
        them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but
        they have refused to receive correction: they have made their
        faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.

005:004 Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for
        they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their
        God.

005:005 I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them;
        for they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of
        their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and
        burst the bonds.

005:006 Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf
        of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over
        their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in
        pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their
        backslidings are increased.

005:007 How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken
        me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to
        the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled
        themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.

005:008 They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed
        after his neighbour's wife.

005:009 Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall
        not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

005:010 Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end:
        take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD's.

005:011 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very
        treacherously against me, saith the LORD.

005:012 They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither
        shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor
        famine:

005:013 And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in
        them: thus shall it be done unto them.

005:014 Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak
        this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and
        this people wood, and it shall devour them.

005:015 Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of
        Israel, saith the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an
        ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not,
        neither understandest what they say.

005:016 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.

005:017 And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy
        sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy
        flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy
        fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein
        thou trustedst, with the sword.

005:018 Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a
        full end with you.

005:019 And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth
        the LORD our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou
        answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange
        gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that
        is not your's.

005:020 Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah,
        saying,

005:021 Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding;
        which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:

005:022 Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my
        presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea
        by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the
        waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail;
        though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?

005:023 But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they
        are revolted and gone.

005:024 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our
        God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his
        season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the
        harvest.

005:025 Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins
        have withholden good things from you.

005:026 For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he
        that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.

005:027 As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of
        deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.

005:028 They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds
        of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the
        fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do
        they not judge.

005:029 Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not
        my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

005:030 A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;

005:031 The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by
        their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will
        ye do in the end thereof?

006:001 O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of
        the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set
        up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of
        the north, and great destruction.

006:002 I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate
        woman.

006:003 The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they
        shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall
        feed every one in his place.

006:004 Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon.
        Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the
        evening are stretched out.

006:005 Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.

006:006 For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and
        cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be
        visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.

006:007 As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her
        wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me
        continually is grief and wounds.

006:008 Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from
        thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.

006:009 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the
        remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a
        grapegatherer into the baskets.

006:010 To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear?
        behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken:
        behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they
        have no delight in it.

006:011 Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with
        holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and
        upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband
        with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full
        of days.

006:012 And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their
        fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon
        the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.

006:013 For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them
        every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even
        unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.

006:014 They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people
        slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

006:015 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
        they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:
        therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time
        that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.

006:016 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask
        for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein,
        and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will
        not walk therein.

006:017 Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of
        the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.

006:018 Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is
        among them.

006:019 Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people,
        even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not
        hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.

006:020 To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the
        sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not
        acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.

006:021 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay
        stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the
        sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his
        friend shall perish.

006:022 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north
        country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of
        the earth.

006:023 They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have
        no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon
        horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter
        of Zion.

006:024 We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish
        hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.

006:025 Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the
        sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.

006:026 O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow
        thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most
        bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon
        us.

006:027 I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people,
        that thou mayest know and try their way.

006:028 They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they
        are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.

006:029 The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the
        founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.

006:030 Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD hath
        rejected them.

007:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

007:002 Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this
        word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah,
        that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.

007:003 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your
        ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this
        place.

007:004 Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD,
        The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.

007:005 For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye
        throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;

007:006 If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow,
        and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after
        other gods to your hurt:

007:007 Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that
        I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.

007:008 Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.

007:009 Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely,
        and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye
        know not;

007:010 And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by
        my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these
        abominations?

007:011 Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of
        robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the
        LORD.

007:012 But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set
        my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the
        wickedness of my people Israel.

007:013 And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD,
        and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye
        heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;

007:014 Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my
        name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you
        and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.

007:015 And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all
        your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.

007:016 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry
        nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I
        will not hear thee.

007:017 Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the
        streets of Jerusalem?

007:018 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and
        the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of
        heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that
        they may provoke me to anger.

007:019 Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not
        provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?

007:020 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine anger and my
        fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon
        beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of
        the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.

007:021 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your
        burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.

007:022 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the
        day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning
        burnt offerings or sacrifices:

007:023 But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I
        will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in
        all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well
        unto you.

007:024 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in
        the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and
        went backward, and not forward.

007:025 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of
        Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants
        the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:

007:026 Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but
        hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.

007:027 Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they
        will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but
        they will not answer thee.

007:028 But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth
        not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction:
        truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.

007:029 Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up
        a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and
        forsaken the generation of his wrath.

007:030 For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith
        the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which
        is called by my name, to pollute it.

007:031 And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the
        valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their
        daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither
        came it into my heart.

007:032 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it
        shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of
        Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in
        Tophet, till there be no place.

007:033 And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of
        the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall
        fray them away.

007:034 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from
        the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of
        gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the
        bride: for the land shall be desolate.

008:001 At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones
        of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the
        bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the
        bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:

008:002 And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and
        all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they
        have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they
        have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be
        gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face
        of the earth.

008:003 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue
        of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all
        the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of
        hosts.

008:004 Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall
        they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?

008:005 Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a
        perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to
        return.

008:006 I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man
        repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done?
        every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the
        battle.

008:007 Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and
        the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of
        their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.

008:008 How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with
        us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes
        is in vain.

008:009 The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo,
        they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in
        them?

008:010 Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their
        fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the
        least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from
        the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.

008:011 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people
        slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

008:012 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay,
        they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush:
        therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of
        their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.

008:013 I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no
        grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf
        shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass
        away from them.

008:014 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter
        into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the
        LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of
        gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.

008:015 We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of
        health, and behold trouble!

008:016 The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land
        trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for
        they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in
        it; the city, and those that dwell therein.

008:017 For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you,
        which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the
        LORD.

008:018 When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint
        in me.

008:019 Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people
        because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD
        in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to
        anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities?

008:020 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not
        saved.

008:021 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am
        black; astonishment hath taken hold on me.

008:022 Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why
        then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?

009:001 Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of
        tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the
        daughter of my people!

009:002 Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring
        men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they
        be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.

009:003 And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they
        are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed
        from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.

009:004 Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in
        any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and
        every neighbour will walk with slanders.

009:005 And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not
        speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies,
        and weary themselves to commit iniquity.

009:006 Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit
        they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.

009:007 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt
        them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my
        people?

009:008 Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one
        speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in
        heart he layeth his wait.

009:009 Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall
        not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

009:010 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and
        for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because
        they are burned up, so that none can pass through them;
        neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of
        the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.

009:011 And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I
        will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.

009:012 Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he
        to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare
        it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a
        wilderness, that none passeth through?

009:013 And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I
        set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked
        therein;

009:014 But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and
        after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:

009:015 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
        Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and
        give them water of gall to drink.

009:016 I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they
        nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after
        them, till I have consumed them.

009:017 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the
        mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning
        women, that they may come:

009:018 And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that
        our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out
        with waters.

009:019 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we
        spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken
        the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.

009:020 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear
        receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters
        wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.

009:021 For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our
        palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young
        men from the streets.

009:022 Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall
        fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the
        harvestman, and none shall gather them.

009:023 Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
        neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the
        rich man glory in his riches:

009:024 But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth
        and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise
        lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for
        in these things I delight, saith the LORD.

009:025 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all
        them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;

009:026 Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and
        Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in
        the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and
        all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.

010:001 Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of
        Israel:

010:002 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be
        not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are
        dismayed at them.

010:003 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree
        out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with
        the axe.

010:004 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with
        nails and with hammers, that it move not.

010:005 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must
        needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them;
        for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do
        good.

010:006 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art
        great, and thy name is great in might.

010:007 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth
        it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the
        nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto
        thee.

010:008 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a
        doctrine of vanities.

010:009 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold
        from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the
        founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the
        work of cunning men.

010:010 But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an
        everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and
        the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.

010:011 Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the
        heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth,
        and from under these heavens.

010:012 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
        world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his
        discretion.

010:013 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in
        the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the
        ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and
        bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.

010:014 Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is
        confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is
        falsehood, and there is no breath in them.

010:015 They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their
        visitation they shall perish.

010:016 The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of
        all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD
        of hosts is his name.

010:017 Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the
        fortress.

010:018 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the
        inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them,
        that they may find it so.

010:019 Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly
        this is a grief, and I must bear it.

010:020 My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my
        children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none
        to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.

010:021 For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the
        LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks
        shall be scattered.

010:022 Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion
        out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah
        desolate, and a den of dragons.

010:023 O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is
        not in man that walketh to direct his steps.

010:024 O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger,
        lest thou bring me to nothing.

010:025 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and
        upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have
        eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have
        made his habitation desolate.

011:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying,

011:002 Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of
        Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;

011:003 And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel;
        Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,

011:004 Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them
        forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying,
        Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command
        you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:

011:005 That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your
        fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as
        it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.

011:006 Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the
        cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear
        ye the words of this covenant, and do them.

011:007 For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I
        brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day,
        rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.

011:008 Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every
        one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will
        bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I
        commanded them to do: but they did them not.

011:009 And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men
        of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

011:010 They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers,
        which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods
        to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have
        broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.

011:011 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon
        them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they
        shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.

011:012 Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem
        go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but
        they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.

011:013 For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O
        Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem
        have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to
        burn incense unto Baal.

011:014 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry
        or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that
        they cry unto me for their trouble.

011:015 What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath
        wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from
        thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.

011:016 The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of
        goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled
        fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.

011:017 For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil
        against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the
        house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to
        provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.

011:018 And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it:
        then thou shewedst me their doings.

011:019 But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the
        slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices
        against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit
        thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living,
        that his name may be no more remembered.

011:020 But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest
        the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for
        unto thee have I revealed my cause.

011:021 Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that
        seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD,
        that thou die not by our hand:

011:022 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish
        them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and
        their daughters shall die by famine:

011:023 And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil
        upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.

012:001 Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me
        talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the
        wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very
        treacherously?

012:002 Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow,
        yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and
        far from their reins.

012:003 But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried
        mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the
        slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.

012:004 How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field
        wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the
        beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He
        shall not see our last end.

012:005 If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee,
        then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of
        peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how
        wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?

012:006 For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they
        have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a
        multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair
        words unto thee.

012:007 I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have
        given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her
        enemies.

012:008 Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth
        out against me: therefore have I hated it.

012:009 Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round
        about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the
        field, come to devour.

012:010 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my
        portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a
        desolate wilderness.

012:011 They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth
        unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man
        layeth it to heart.

012:012 The spoilers are come upon all high places through the
        wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the
        one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no
        flesh shall have peace.

012:013 They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put
        themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be
        ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the
        LORD.

012:014 Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that
        touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to
        inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and
        pluck out the house of Judah from among them.

012:015 And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out
        I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring
        them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his
        land.

012:016 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the
        ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as
        they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be
        built in the midst of my people.

012:017 But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy
        that nation, saith the LORD.

013:001 Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle,
        and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.

013:002 So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put
        it on my loins.

013:003 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,

013:004 Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins,
        and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the
        rock.

013:005 So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.

013:006 And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto
        me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence,
        which I commanded thee to hide there.

013:007 Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from
        the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was
        marred, it was profitable for nothing.

013:008 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

013:009 Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of
        Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.

013:010 This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in
        the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to
        serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle,
        which is good for nothing.

013:011 For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I
        caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the
        whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto
        me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a
        glory: but they would not hear.

013:012 Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the
        LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine:
        and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that
        every bottle shall be filled with wine?

013:013 Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I
        will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings
        that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the
        prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with
        drunkenness.

013:014 And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and
        the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare,
        nor have mercy, but destroy them.

013:015 Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.

013:016 Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and
        before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while
        ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and
        make it gross darkness.

013:017 But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret
        places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run
        down with tears, because the LORD's flock is carried away
        captive.

013:018 Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit
        down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown
        of your glory.

013:019 The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open
        them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall
        be wholly carried away captive.

013:020 Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north:
        where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?

013:021 What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast
        taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not
        sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?

013:022 And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things
        upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts
        discovered, and thy heels made bare.

013:023 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
        then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.

013:024 Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away
        by the wind of the wilderness.

013:025 This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith
        the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in
        falsehood.

013:026 Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy
        shame may appear.

013:027 I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness
        of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the
        fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made
        clean? when shall it once be?

014:001 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the
        dearth.

014:002 Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black
        unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.

014:003 And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters:
        they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with
        their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and
        covered their heads.

014:004 Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the
        earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.

014:005 Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it,
        because there was no grass.

014:006 And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed
        up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there
        was no grass.

014:007 O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it
        for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have
        sinned against thee.

014:008 O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble,
        why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a
        wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?

014:009 Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that
        cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we
        are called by thy name; leave us not.

014:010 Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to
        wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD
        doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and
        visit their sins.

014:011 Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their
        good.

014:012 When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer
        burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I
        will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the
        pestilence.

014:013 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them,
        Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but
        I will give you assured peace in this place.

014:014 Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my
        name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither
        spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and
        divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their
        heart.

014:015 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that
        prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword
        and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine
        shall those prophets be consumed.

014:016 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the
        streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and
        they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor
        their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their
        wickedness upon them.

014:017 Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes
        run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for
        the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great
        breach, with a very grievous blow.

014:018 If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the
        sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are
        sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go
        about into a land that they know not.

014:019 Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion?
        why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we
        looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of
        healing, and behold trouble!

014:020 We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of
        our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.

014:021 Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the
        throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.

014:022 Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can
        cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he,
        O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou
        hast made all these things.

015:001 Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood
        before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast
        them out of my sight, and let them go forth.

015:002 And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither
        shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the
        LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the
        sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the
        famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.

015:003 And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the
        sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the
        heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.

015:004 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the
        earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah,
        for that which he did in Jerusalem.

015:005 For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall
        bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?

015:006 Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward:
        therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy
        thee; I am weary with repenting.

015:007 And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I
        will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since
        they return not from their ways.

015:008 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I
        have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a
        spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it
        suddenly, and terrors upon the city.

015:009 She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the
        ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath
        been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I
        deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.

015:010 Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife
        and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither
        lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one
        of them doth curse me.

015:011 The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant;
        verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time
        of evil and in the time of affliction.

015:012 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?

015:013 Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil
        without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy
        borders.

015:014 And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land
        which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger,
        which shall burn upon you.

015:015 O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge
        me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering:
        know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.

015:016 Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was
        unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called
        by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.

015:017 I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat
        alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with
        indignation.

015:018 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which
        refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a
        liar, and as waters that fail?

015:019 Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I
        bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou
        take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my
        mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto
        them.

015:020 And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall:
        and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail
        against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver
        thee, saith the LORD.

015:021 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I
        will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.

016:001 The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying,

016:002 Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons
        or daughters in this place.

016:003 For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the
        daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their
        mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that
        begat them in this land;

016:004 They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented;
        neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon
        the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the
        sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the
        fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

016:005 For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning,
        neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my
        peace from this people, saith the LORD, even lovingkindness
        and mercies.

016:006 Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they
        shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor
        cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:

016:007 Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to
        comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup
        of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.

016:008 Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with
        them to eat and to drink.

016:009 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
        will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in
        your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the
        voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.

016:010 And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people
        all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath
        the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is
        our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed
        against the LORD our God?

016:011 Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have
        forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods,
        and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have
        forsaken me, and have not kept my law;

016:012 And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk
        every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they
        may not hearken unto me:

016:013 Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye
        know not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye
        serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you
        favour.

016:014 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it
        shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the
        children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;

016:015 But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel
        from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he
        had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land
        that I gave unto their fathers.

016:016 Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they
        shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and
        they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill,
        and out of the holes of the rocks.

016:017 For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from
        my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.

016:018 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin
        double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled
        mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and
        abominable things.

016:019 O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day
        of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends
        of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited
        lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.

016:020 Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?

016:021 Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will
        cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know
        that my name is The LORD.

017:001 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the
        point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their
        heart, and upon the horns of your altars;

017:002 Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves
        by the green trees upon the high hills.

017:003 O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all
        thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin,
        throughout all thy borders.

017:004 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage
        that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies
        in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire
        in mine anger, which shall burn for ever.

017:005 Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man,
        and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the
        LORD.

017:006 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not
        see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in
        the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.

017:007 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope
        the LORD is.

017:008 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that
        spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when
        heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be
        careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from
        yielding fruit.

017:009 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
        wicked: who can know it?

017:010 I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give
        every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of
        his doings.

017:011 As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he
        that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the
        midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.

017:012 A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our
        sanctuary.

017:013 O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be
        ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the
        earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of
        living waters.

017:014 Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall
        be saved: for thou art my praise.

017:015 Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let
        it come now.

017:016 As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow
        thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest:
        that which came out of my lips was right before thee.

017:017 Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.

017:018 Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be
        confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed:
        bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double
        destruction.

017:019 Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the
        children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in,
        and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of
        Jerusalem;

017:020 And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of
        Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
        that enter in by these gates:

017:021 Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no
        burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of
        Jerusalem;

017:022 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath
        day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as
        I commanded your fathers.

017:023 But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made
        their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive
        instruction.

017:024 And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me,
        saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of
        this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to
        do no work therein;

017:025 Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and
        princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots
        and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and
        the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for
        ever.

017:026 And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the
        places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and
        from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south,
        bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings,
        and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house
        of the LORD.

017:027 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day,
        and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of
        Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the
        gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem,
        and it shall not be quenched.

018:001 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

018:002 Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will
        cause thee to hear my words.

018:003 Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he
        wrought a work on the wheels.

018:004 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of
        the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good
        to the potter to make it.

018:005 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

018:006 O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith
        the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are
        ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.

018:007 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and
        concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to
        destroy it;

018:008 If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from
        their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do
        unto them.

018:009 And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and
        concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;

018:010 If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I
        will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit
        them.

018:011 Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the
        inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold,
        I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you:
        return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways
        and your doings good.

018:012 And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our
        own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his
        evil heart.

018:013 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen,
        who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a
        very horrible thing.

018:014 Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the
        rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come
        from another place be forsaken?

018:015 Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense
        to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways
        from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast
        up;

018:016 To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every
        one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his
        head.

018:017 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I
        will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their
        calamity.

018:018 Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against
        Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor
        counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come,
        and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed
        to any of his words.

018:019 Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that
        contend with me.

018:020 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit
        for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good
        for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.

018:021 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour
        out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives
        be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their
        men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword
        in battle.

018:022 Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a
        troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take
        me, and hid snares for my feet.

018:023 Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay
        me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin
        from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal
        thus with them in the time of thine anger.

019:001 Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and
        take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the
        priests;

019:002 And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by
        the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that
        I shall tell thee,

019:003 And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and
        inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the
        God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the
        which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.

019:004 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place,
        and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither
        they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and
        have filled this place with the blood of innocents;

019:005 They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their
        sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I
        commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:

019:006 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this
        place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the
        son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.

019:007 And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in
        this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before
        their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives:
        and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the
        heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

019:008 And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one
        that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of
        all the plagues thereof.

019:009 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the
        flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the
        flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith
        their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten
        them.

019:010 Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that
        go with thee,

019:011 And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so
        will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a
        potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they
        shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.

019:012 Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the
        inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet:

019:013 And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of
        Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all
        the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all
        the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto
        other gods.

019:014 Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him
        to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD's house;
        and said to all the people,

019:015 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
        will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil
        that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened
        their necks, that they might not hear my words.

020:001 Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief
        governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah
        prophesied these things.

020:002 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the
        stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by
        the house of the LORD.

020:003 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth
        Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The
        LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib.

020:004 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to
        thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the
        sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I
        will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and
        he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them
        with the sword.

020:005 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all
        the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and
        all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the
        hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them,
        and carry them to Babylon.

020:006 And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go
        into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou
        shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy
        friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.

020:007 O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art
        stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily,
        every one mocketh me.

020:008 For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil;
        because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and
        a derision, daily.

020:009 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any
        more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning
        fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and
        I could not stay.

020:010 For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report,
        say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for
        my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we
        shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on
        him.

020:011 But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my
        persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they
        shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their
        everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.

020:012 But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the
        reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for
        unto thee have I opened my cause.

020:013 Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered
        the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.

020:014 Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein
        my mother bare me be blessed.

020:015 Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A
        man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.

020:016 And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew,
        and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and
        the shouting at noontide;

020:017 Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might
        have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.

020:018 Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and
        sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?

021:001 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king
        Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and
        Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,

021:002 Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar
        king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD
        will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he
        may go up from us.

021:003 Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:

021:004 Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back
        the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight
        against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which
        besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into
        the midst of this city.

021:005 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand
        and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in
        great wrath.

021:006 And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and
        beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.

021:007 And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of
        Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left
        in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the
        famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and
        into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those
        that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of
        the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor
        have mercy.

021:008 And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD;
        Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of
        death.

021:009 He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by
        the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and
        falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and
        his life shall be unto him for a prey.

021:010 For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for
        good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the
        king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.

021:011 And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the
        word of the LORD;

021:012 O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the
        morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of
        the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that
        none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.

021:013 Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and
        rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come
        down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?

021:014 But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings,
        saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the forest
        thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.

022:001 Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of
        Judah, and speak there this word,

022:002 And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that
        sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and
        thy people that enter in by these gates:

022:003 Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness,
        and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and
        do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless,
        nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.

022:004 For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by
        the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of
        David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants,
        and his people.

022:005 But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith
        the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.

022:006 For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of Judah; Thou
        art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will
        make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.

022:007 And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his
        weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast
        them into the fire.

022:008 And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say
        every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus
        unto this great city?

022:009 Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the
        covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and
        served them.

022:010 Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore
        for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see
        his native country.

022:011 For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah
        king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father,
        which went forth out of this place; He shall not return
        thither any more:

022:012 But he shall die in the place whither they have led him
        captive, and shall see this land no more.

022:013 Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and
        his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service
        without wages, and giveth him not for his work;

022:014 That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers,
        and cutteth him out windows; and it is cieled with cedar, and
        painted with vermilion.

022:015 Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did
        not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and
        then it was well with him?

022:016 He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well
        with him: was not this to know me? saith the LORD.

022:017 But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy
        covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for
        oppression, and for violence, to do it.

022:018 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of
        Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying,
        Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him,
        saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!

022:019 He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast
        forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.

022:020 Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan,
        and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.

022:021 I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will
        not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou
        obeyedst not my voice.

022:022 The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go
        into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and
        confounded for all thy wickedness.

022:023 O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars,
        how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain
        as of a woman in travail!

022:024 As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim
        king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I
        pluck thee thence;

022:025 And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life,
        and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into
        the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand
        of the Chaldeans.

022:026 And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into
        another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye
        die.

022:027 But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall
        they not return.

022:028 Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel
        wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and
        his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?

022:029 O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.

022:030 Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that
        shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall
        prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more
        in Judah.

023:001 Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of
        my pasture! saith the LORD.

023:002 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the
        pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and
        driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will
        visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.

023:003 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries
        whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their
        folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.

023:004 And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them:
        and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall
        they be lacking, saith the LORD.

023:005 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto
        David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper,
        and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.

023:006 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell
        safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE
        LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.

023:007 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they
        shall no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the
        children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;

023:008 But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed
        of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all
        countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in
        their own land.

023:009 Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my
        bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine
        hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words
        of his holiness.

023:010 For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing
        the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are
        dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not
        right.

023:011 For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have
        I found their wickedness, saith the LORD.

023:012 Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the
        darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I
        will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation,
        saith the LORD.

023:013 And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they
        prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.

023:014 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible
        thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen
        also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his
        wickedness; they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the
        inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.

023:015 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the
        prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make
        them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of
        Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.

023:016 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of
        the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they
        speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of
        the LORD.

023:017 They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said,
        Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh
        after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come
        upon you.

023:018 For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath
        perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and
        heard it?

023:019 Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a
        grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of
        the wicked.

023:020 The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have
        executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his
        heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.

023:021 I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not
        spoken to them, yet they prophesied.

023:022 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people
        to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their
        evil way, and from the evil of their doings.

023:023 Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?

023:024 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see
        him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the
        LORD.

023:025 I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my
        name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.

023:026 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that
        prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their
        own heart;

023:027 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their
        dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their
        fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.

023:028 The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he
        that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is
        the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD.

023:029 Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a
        hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?

023:030 Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD,
        that steal my words every one from his neighbour.

023:031 Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use
        their tongues, and say, He saith.

023:032 Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith
        the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by
        their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor
        commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at
        all, saith the LORD.

023:033 And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask
        thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then
        say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the
        LORD.

023:034 And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that
        shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man
        and his house.

023:035 Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to
        his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the
        LORD spoken?

023:036 And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every
        man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the
        words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God.

023:037 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD
        answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?

023:038 But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith
        the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD,
        and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden
        of the LORD;

023:039 Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I
        will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your
        fathers, and cast you out of my presence:

023:040 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a
        perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

024:001 The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set
        before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king
        of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of
        Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the
        carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to
        Babylon.

024:002 One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are
        first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which
        could not be eaten, they were so bad.

024:003 Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I
        said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil,
        that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

024:004 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

024:005 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs,
        so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of
        Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the
        Chaldeans for their good.

024:006 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring
        them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull
        them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.

024:007 And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD:
        and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they
        shall return unto me with their whole heart.

024:008 And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil;
        surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king
        of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that
        remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:

024:009 And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of
        the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a
        taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.

024:010 And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence,
        among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I
        gave unto them and to their fathers.

025:001 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of
        Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
        of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of
        Babylon;

025:002 The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of
        Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,

025:003 From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of
        Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth
        year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have
        spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not
        hearkened.

025:004 And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets,
        rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor
        inclined your ear to hear.

025:005 They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and
        from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the
        LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and
        ever:

025:006 And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship
        them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your
        hands; and I will do you no hurt.

025:007 Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye
        might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your
        own hurt.

025:008 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not
        heard my words,

025:009 Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,
        saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my
        servant, and will bring them against this land, and against
        the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round
        about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an
        astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.

025:010 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the
        voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice
        of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of
        the candle.

025:011 And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an
        astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of
        Babylon seventy years.

025:012 And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are
        accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that
        nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of
        the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.

025:013 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have
        pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book,
        which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.

025:014 For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of
        them also: and I will recompense them according to their
        deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.

025:015 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine
        cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to
        whom I send thee, to drink it.

025:016 And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the
        sword that I will send among them.

025:017 Then took I the cup at the LORD's hand, and made all the
        nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:

025:018 To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings
        thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation,
        an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day;

025:019 Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and
        all his people;

025:020 And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of
        Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and
        Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,

025:021 Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,

025:022 And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and
        the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea,

025:023 Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the utmost
        corners,

025:024 And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled
        people that dwell in the desert,

025:025 And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all
        the kings of the Medes,

025:026 And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with
        another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the
        face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after
        them.

025:027 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of
        hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue,
        and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will
        send among you.

025:028 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand
        to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD
        of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.

025:029 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by
        my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be
        unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the
        inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.

025:030 Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say
        unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his
        voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon
        his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the
        grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.

025:031 A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD
        hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all
        flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith
        the LORD.

025:032 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from
        nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up
        from the coasts of the earth.

025:033 And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of
        the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not
        be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung
        upon the ground.

025:034 Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the
        ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your
        slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye
        shall fall like a pleasant vessel.

025:035 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal
        of the flock to escape.

025:036 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the
        principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath
        spoiled their pasture.

025:037 And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the
        fierce anger of the LORD.

025:038 He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is
        desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and
        because of his fierce anger.

026:001 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
        king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,

026:002 Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's house,
        and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship
        in the LORD's house, all the words that I command thee to
        speak unto them; diminish not a word:

026:003 If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil
        way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do
        unto them because of the evil of their doings.

026:004 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will
        not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before
        you,

026:005 To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I
        sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye
        have not hearkened;

026:006 Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this
        city a curse to all the nations of the earth.

026:007 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard
        Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.

026:008 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking
        all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the
        people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people
        took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.

026:009 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This
        house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate
        without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered
        against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.

026:010 When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came
        up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat
        down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house.

026:011 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and
        to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he
        hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your
        ears.

026:012 Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the
        people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this
        house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.

026:013 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the
        voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of
        the evil that he hath pronounced against you.

026:014 As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth
        good and meet unto you.

026:015 But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall
        surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this
        city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the
        LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your
        ears.

026:016 Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and
        to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath
        spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.

026:017 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to
        all the assembly of the people, saying,

026:018 Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king
        of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus
        saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field,
        and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the
        house as the high places of a forest.

026:019 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to
        death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and
        the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced
        against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our
        souls.

026:020 And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the
        LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who
        prophesied against this city and against this land according
        to all the words of Jeremiah.

026:021 And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all
        the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to
        death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and
        went into Egypt;

026:022 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan
        the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.

026:023 And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him
        unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast
        his dead body into the graves of the common people.

026:024 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with
        Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the
        people to put him to death.

027:001 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
        king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD,
        saying,

027:002 Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put
        them upon thy neck,

027:003 And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab,
        and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus,
        and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which
        come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;

027:004 And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the
        LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your
        masters;

027:005 I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the
        ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have
        given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.

027:006 And now have I given all these lands into the hand of
        Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts
        of the field have I given him also to serve him.

027:007 And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's
        son, until the very time of his land come: and then many
        nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.

027:008 And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which
        will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon,
        and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of
        Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the
        sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I
        have consumed them by his hand.

027:009 Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your
        diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to
        your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not
        serve the king of Babylon:

027:010 For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your
        land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.

027:011 But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the
        king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still
        in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and
        dwell therein.

027:012 I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these
        words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of
        Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.

027:013 Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the
        famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against
        the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?

027:014 Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that
        speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of
        Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.

027:015 For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a
        lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might
        perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.

027:016 Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying,
        Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets
        that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the
        LORD's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon:
        for they prophesy a lie unto you.

027:017 Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
        wherefore should this city be laid waste?

027:018 But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with
        them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts,
        that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and
        in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to
        Babylon.

027:019 For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and
        concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning
        the residue of the vessels that remain in this city.

027:020 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried
        away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from
        Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and
        Jerusalem;

027:021 Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,
        concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD,
        and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;

027:022 They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be
        until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I
        bring them up, and restore them to this place.

028:001 And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the
        reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in
        the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet,
        which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD,
        in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,

028:002 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I
        have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.

028:003 Within two full years will I bring again into this place all
        the vessels of the LORD's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of
        Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to
        Babylon:

028:004 And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of
        Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that
        went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke
        of the king of Babylon.

028:005 Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in
        the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the
        people that stood in the house of the LORD,

028:006 Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD
        perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again
        the vessels of the LORD's house, and all that is carried away
        captive, from Babylon into this place.

028:007 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine
        ears, and in the ears of all the people;

028:008 The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old
        prophesied both against many countries, and against great
        kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.

028:009 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the
        prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known,
        that the LORD hath truly sent him.

028:010 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
        Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.

028:011 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying,
        Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations
        within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah
        went his way.

028:012 Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet,
        after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off
        the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,

028:013 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast
        broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes
        of iron.

028:014 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have
        put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that
        they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall
        serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.

028:015 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear
        now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest
        this people to trust in a lie.

028:016 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from
        off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because
        thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.

028:017 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh
        month.

029:001 Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the
        prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders
        which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to
        the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had
        carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;

029:002 (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs,
        the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and
        the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)

029:003 By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son
        of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,

029:004 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that
        are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried
        away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;

029:005 Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat
        the fruit of them;

029:006 Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives
        for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they
        may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there,
        and not diminished.

029:007 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be
        carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in
        the peace thereof shall ye have peace.

029:008 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not
        your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you,
        deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to
        be dreamed.

029:009 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent
        them, saith the LORD.

029:010 For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be
        accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good
        word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.

029:011 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the
        LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an
        expected end.

029:012 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me,
        and I will hearken unto you.

029:013 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me
        with all your heart.

029:014 And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn
        away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the
        nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you,
        saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place
        whence I caused you to be carried away captive.

029:015 Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in
        Babylon;

029:016 Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon
        the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in
        this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with
        you into captivity;

029:017 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them
        the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them
        like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

029:018 And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and
        with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to
        all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an
        astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the
        nations whither I have driven them:

029:019 Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD,
        which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up
        early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.

029:020 Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the
        captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:

029:021 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the
        son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which
        prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver
        them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he
        shall slay them before your eyes;

029:022 And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of
        Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like
        Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in
        the fire;

029:023 Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have
        committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have
        spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded
        them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD.

029:024 Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,

029:025 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,
        Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people
        that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah
        the priest, and to all the priests, saying,

029:026 The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the
        priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD,
        for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that
        thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.

029:027 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,
        which maketh himself a prophet to you?

029:028 For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This
        captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and
        plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

029:029 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of
        Jeremiah the prophet.

029:030 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

029:031 Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD
        concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath
        prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to
        trust in a lie:

029:032 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah
        the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell
        among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I
        will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught
        rebellion against the LORD.

030:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

030:002 Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all
        the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.

030:003 For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring
        again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the
        LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave
        to their fathers, and they shall possess it.

030:004 And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel
        and concerning Judah.

030:005 For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling,
        of fear, and not of peace.

030:006 Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?
        wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a
        woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?

030:007 Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is
        even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of
        it.

030:008 For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of
        hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will
        burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves
        of him:

030:009 But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king,
        whom I will raise up unto them.

030:010 Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD;
        neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from
        afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob
        shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none
        shall make him afraid.

030:011 For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I
        make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee,
        yet I will not make a full end of thee: but I will correct
        thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether
        unpunished.

030:012 For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy
        wound is grievous.

030:013 There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound
        up: thou hast no healing medicines.

030:014 All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I
        have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the
        chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine
        iniquity; because thy sins were increased.

030:015 Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable
        for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were
        increased, I have done these things unto thee.

030:016 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all
        thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity;
        and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey
        upon thee will I give for a prey.

030:017 For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of
        thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an
        Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.

030:018 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity
        of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and
        the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace
        shall remain after the manner thereof.

030:019 And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of
        them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall
        not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be
        small.

030:020 Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their
        congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish
        all that oppress them.

030:021 And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor
        shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to
        draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that
        engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.

030:022 And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

030:023 Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a
        continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of
        the wicked.

030:024 The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath
        done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart:
        in the latter days ye shall consider it.

031:001 At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the
        families of Israel, and they shall be my people.

031:002 Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword
        found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to
        cause him to rest.

031:003 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have
        loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with
        lovingkindness have I drawn thee.

031:004 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of
        Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and
        shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.

031:005 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
        planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.

031:006 For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount
        Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the
        LORD our God.

031:007 For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and
        shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye,
        and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.

031:008 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather
        them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and
        the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with
        child together: a great company shall return thither.

031:009 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I
        lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters
        in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a
        father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.

031:010 Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the
        isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather
        him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.

031:011 For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the
        hand of him that was stronger than he.

031:012 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and
        shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat,
        and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and
        of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and
        they shall not sorrow any more at all.

031:013 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and
        old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and
        will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.

031:014 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and
        my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.

031:015 Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation,
        and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to
        be comforted for her children, because they were not.

031:016 Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine
        eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the
        LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.

031:017 And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy
        children shall come again to their own border.

031:018 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast
        chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed
        to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art
        the LORD my God.

031:019 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I
        was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea,
        even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.

031:020 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I
        spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still:
        therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have
        mercy upon him, saith the LORD.

031:021 Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart
        toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn
        again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.

031:022 How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for
        the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall
        compass a man.

031:023 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they
        shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities
        thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD
        bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.

031:024 And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities
        thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with
        flocks.

031:025 For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished
        every sorrowful soul.

031:026 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto
        me.

031:027 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the
        house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man,
        and with the seed of beast.

031:028 And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over
        them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and
        to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to
        build, and to plant, saith the LORD.

031:029 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a
        sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.

031:030 But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that
        eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.

031:031 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new
        covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of
        Judah:

031:032 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
        in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of
        the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I
        was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:

031:033 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house
        of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law
        in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will
        be their God, and they shall be my people.

031:034 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and
        every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall
        all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,
        saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will
        remember their sin no more.

031:035 Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day,
        and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by
        night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The
        LORD of hosts is his name:

031:036 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD,
        then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation
        before me for ever.

031:037 Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the
        foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also
        cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done,
        saith the LORD.

031:038 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be
        built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of
        the corner.

031:039 And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon
        the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.

031:040 And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and
        all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of
        the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD;
        it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

032:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year
        of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of
        Nebuchadrezzar.

032:002 For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and
        Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison,
        which was in the king of Judah's house.

032:003 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore
        dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I
        will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and
        he shall take it;

032:004 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of
        the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of
        the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth,
        and his eyes shall behold his eyes;

032:005 And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be
        until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the
        Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.

032:006 And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

032:007 Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come
        unto thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for
        the right of redemption is thine to buy it.

032:008 So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the
        prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me,
        Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in
        the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is
        thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I
        knew that this was the word of the LORD.

032:009 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in
        Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of
        silver.

032:010 And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took
        witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.

032:011 So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was
        sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was
        open:

032:012 And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of
        Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine
        uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that
        subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that
        sat in the court of the prison.

032:013 And I charged Baruch before them, saying,

032:014 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these
        evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is
        sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an
        earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.

032:015 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses
        and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this
        land.

032:016 Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto
        Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,

032:017 Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth
        by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing
        too hard for thee:

032:018 Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest
        the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children
        after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is
        his name,

032:019 Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open
        upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one
        according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his
        doings:

032:020 Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even
        unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast
        made thee a name, as at this day;

032:021 And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of
        Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand,
        and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;

032:022 And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their
        fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;

032:023 And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy
        voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of
        all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast
        caused all this evil to come upon them:

032:024 Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and
        the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight
        against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of
        the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass;
        and, behold, thou seest it.

032:025 And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for
        money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand
        of the Chaldeans.

032:026 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

032:027 Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any
        thing too hard for me?

032:028 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city
        into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:

032:029 And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come
        and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon
        whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured
        out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.

032:030 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only
        done evil before me from their youth: for the children of
        Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their
        hands, saith the LORD.

032:031 For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger
        and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this
        day; that I should remove it from before my face,

032:032 Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the
        children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to
        anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and
        their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of
        Jerusalem.

032:033 And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face:
        though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet
        they have not hearkened to receive instruction.

032:034 But they set their abominations in the house, which is called
        by my name, to defile it.

032:035 And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the
        valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their
        daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I
        commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they
        should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.

032:036 And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,
        concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered
        into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the
        famine, and by the pestilence;

032:037 Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I
        have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great
        wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will
        cause them to dwell safely:

032:038 And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:

032:039 And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may
        fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children
        after them:

032:040 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will
        not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my
        fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.

032:041 Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will
        plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with
        my whole soul.

032:042 For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great
        evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good
        that I have promised them.

032:043 And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is
        desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of
        the Chaldeans.

032:044 Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and
        seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in
        the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in
        the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley,
        and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their
        captivity to return, saith the LORD.

033:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second
        time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison,
        saying,

033:002 Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed
        it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;

033:003 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and
        mighty things, which thou knowest not.

033:004 For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the
        houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of
        Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;

033:005 They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them
        with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger
        and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my
        face from this city.

033:006 Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them,
        and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.

033:007 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of
        Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.

033:008 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they
        have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their
        iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have
        transgressed against me.

033:009 And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour
        before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the
        good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for
        all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure
        unto it.

033:010 Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place,
        which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast,
        even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem,
        that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and
        without beast,

033:011 The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
        bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that
        shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for
        his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the
        sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will
        cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first,
        saith the LORD.

033:012 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is
        desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities
        thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their
        flocks to lie down.

033:013 In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and
        in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and
        in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah,
        shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that
        telleth them, saith the LORD.

033:014 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform
        that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel
        and to the house of Judah.

033:015 In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
        righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute
        judgment and righteousness in the land.

033:016 In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell
        safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called,
        The LORD our righteousness.

033:017 For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit
        upon the throne of the house of Israel;

033:018 Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to
        offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do
        sacrifice continually.

033:019 And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,

033:020 Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day,
        and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day
        and night in their season;

033:021 Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant,
        that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and
        with the Levites the priests, my ministers.

033:022 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of
        the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my
        servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.

033:023 Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,

033:024 Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The
        two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast
        them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should
        be no more a nation before them.

033:025 Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night,
        and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and
        earth;

033:026 Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant,
        so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the
        seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their
        captivity to return, and have mercy on them.

034:001 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the
        kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people,
        fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof,
        saying,

034:002 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to
        Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD;
        Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of
        Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:

034:003 And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be
        taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall
        behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak
        with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.

034:004 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus
        saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:

034:005 But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy
        fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall
        they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying,
        Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.

034:006 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah
        king of Judah in Jerusalem,

034:007 When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and
        against all the cities of Judah that were left, against
        Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities
        remained of the cities of Judah.

034:008 This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after
        that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people
        which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;

034:009 That every man should let his manservant, and every man his
        maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that
        none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his
        brother.

034:010 Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had
        entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his
        manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none
        should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed,
        and let them go.

034:011 But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the
        handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought
        them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.

034:012 Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
        saying,

034:013 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with
        your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the
        land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,

034:014 At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an
        Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath
        served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee:
        but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their
        ear.

034:015 And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in
        proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had
        made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my
        name:

034:016 But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his
        servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at
        liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into
        subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.

034:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me,
        in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every
        man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you,
        saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the
        famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the
        kingdoms of the earth.

034:018 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant,
        which have not performed the words of the covenant which they
        had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and
        passed between the parts thereof,

034:019 The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the
        eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land,
        which passed between the parts of the calf;

034:020 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into
        the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies
        shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the
        beasts of the earth.

034:021 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into
        the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek
        their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army,
        which are gone up from you.

034:022 Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to
        return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take
        it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah
        a desolation without an inhabitant.

035:001 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of
        Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,

035:002 Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and
        bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the
        chambers, and give them wine to drink.

035:003 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of
        Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole
        house of the Rechabites;

035:004 And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the
        chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of
        God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above
        the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the
        door:

035:005 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots
        full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.

035:006 But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of
        Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no
        wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever:

035:007 Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant
        vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in
        tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be
        strangers.

035:008 Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our
        father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all
        our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;

035:009 Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we
        vineyard, nor field, nor seed:

035:010 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done
        according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.

035:011 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came
        up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to
        Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear
        of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.

035:012 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,

035:013 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell
        the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not
        receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.

035:014 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his
        sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they
        drink none, but obey their father's commandment:
        notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and
        speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.

035:015 I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
        up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man
        from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after
        other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which
        I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not
        inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.

035:016 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed
        the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but
        this people hath not hearkened unto me:

035:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel;
        Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them:
        because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and
        I have called unto them, but they have not answered.

035:018 And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith
        the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed
        the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his
        precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded
        you:

035:019 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
        Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before
        me for ever.

036:001 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of
        Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from
        the LORD, saying,

036:002 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words
        that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against
        Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto
        thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.

036:003 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which
        I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from
        his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.

036:004 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch
        wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD,
        which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.

036:005 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot
        go into the house of the LORD:

036:006 Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast
        written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of
        the people in the LORD's house upon the fasting day: and also
        thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of
        their cities.

036:007 It may be they will present their supplication before the
        LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great
        is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced
        against this people.

036:008 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that
        Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the
        words of the LORD in the LORD's house.

036:009 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of
        Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed
        a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to
        all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto
        Jerusalem.

036:010 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the
        house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of
        Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the
        new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.

036:011 When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had
        heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,

036:012 Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's
        chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the
        scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son
        of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the
        son of Hananiah, and all the princes.

036:013 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had
        heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.

036:014 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah,
        the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying,
        Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears
        of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the
        roll in his hand, and came unto them.

036:015 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.
        So Baruch read it in their ears.

036:016 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they
        were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will
        surely tell the king of all these words.

036:017 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou
        write all these words at his mouth?

036:018 Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto
        me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.

036:019 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and
        Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.

036:020 And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up
        the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all
        the words in the ears of the king.

036:021 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out
        of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the
        ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which
        stood beside the king.

036:022 Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and
        there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.

036:023 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four
        leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire
        that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the
        fire that was on the hearth.

036:024 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the
        king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.

036:025 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
        intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but
        he would not hear them.

036:026 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and
        Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to
        take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD
        hid them.

036:027 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the
        king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at
        the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,

036:028 Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former
        words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of
        Judah hath burned.

036:029 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the
        LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou
        written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly
        come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from
        thence man and beast?

036:030 Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He
        shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead
        body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the
        night to the frost.

036:031 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their
        iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I
        have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.

036:032 Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the
        scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of
        Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of
        Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides
        unto them many like words.

037:001 And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah
        the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made
        king in the land of Judah.

037:002 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land,
        did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the
        prophet Jeremiah.

037:003 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and
        Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet
        Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.

037:004 Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they
        had not put him into prison.

037:005 Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the
        Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they
        departed from Jerusalem.

037:006 Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah
        saying,

037:007 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to
        the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me;
        Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall
        return to Egypt into their own land.

037:008 And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this
        city, and take it, and burn it with fire.

037:009 Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The
        Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not
        depart.

037:010 For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that
        fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among
        them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn
        this city with fire.

037:011 And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was
        broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,

037:012 Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land
        of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the
        people.

037:013 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward
        was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the
        son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
        Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.

037:014 Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the
        Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took
        Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.

037:015 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him,
        and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for
        they had made that the prison.

037:016 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the
        cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;

037:017 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king
        asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word
        from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou
        shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.

037:018 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I
        offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against
        this people, that ye have put me in prison?

037:019 Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying,
        The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against
        this land?

037:020 Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my
        supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou
        cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe,
        lest I die there.

037:021 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit
        Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should
        give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street,
        until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah
        remained in the court of the prison.

038:001 Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of
        Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of
        Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all
        the people, saying,

038:002 Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die
        by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he
        that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall
        have his life for a prey, and shall live.

038:003 Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the
        hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.

038:004 Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let
        this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of
        the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all
        the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man
        seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.

038:005 Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for
        the king is not he that can do any thing against you.

038:006 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of
        Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the
        prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the
        dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the
        mire.

038:007 Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which
        was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in
        the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;

038:008 Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to
        the king saying,

038:009 My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they
        have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into
        the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place
        where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.

038:010 Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take
        from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the
        prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.

038:011 So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house
        of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast
        clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into
        the dungeon to Jeremiah.

038:012 And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these
        old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the
        cords. And Jeremiah did so.

038:013 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of
        the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

038:014 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet
        unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the
        LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a
        thing; hide nothing from me.

038:015 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee,
        wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee
        counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?

038:016 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As
        the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee
        to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men
        that seek thy life.

038:017 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God
        of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth
        unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live,
        and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt
        live, and thine house:

038:018 But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's
        princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the
        Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt
        not escape out of their hand.

038:019 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the
        Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me
        into their hand, and they mock me.

038:020 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I
        beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee:
        so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.

038:021 But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD
        hath shewed me:

038:022 And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of
        Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's
        princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee
        on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the
        mire, and they are turned away back.

038:023 So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the
        Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but
        shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou
        shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.

038:024 Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these
        words, and thou shalt not die.

038:025 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they
        come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what
        thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will
        not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:

038:026 Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication
        before the king, that he would not cause me to return to
        Jonathan's house, to die there.

038:027 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he
        told them according to all these words that the king had
        commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter
        was not perceived.

038:028 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day
        that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was
        taken.

039:001 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth
        month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army
        against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.

039:002 And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the
        ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.

039:003 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in
        the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim,
        Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the
        princes of the king of Babylon.

039:004 And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw
        them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth
        out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by
        the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the
        plain.

039:005 But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook
        Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken
        him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to
        Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.

039:006 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah
        before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles
        of Judah.

039:007 Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with
        chains, to carry him to Babylon.

039:008 And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of
        the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.

039:009 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
        into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the
        city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the
        rest of the people that remained.

039:010 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of
        the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave
        them vineyards and fields at the same time.

039:011 Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning
        Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,

039:012 Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do
        unto him even as he shall say unto thee.

039:013 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban,
        Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of
        Babylon's princes;

039:014 Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the
        prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the
        son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt
        among the people.

039:015 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut
        up in the court of the prison, saying,

039:016 Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith
        the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my
        words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they
        shall be accomplished in that day before thee.

039:017 But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou
        shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art
        afraid.

039:018 For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the
        sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because
        thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.

040:001 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that
        Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from
        Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all
        that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which
        were carried away captive unto Babylon.

040:002 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him,
        The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.

040:003 Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath
        said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not
        obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.

040:004 And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which
        were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with
        me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if
        it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear:
        behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good
        and convenient for thee to go, thither go.

040:005 Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to
        Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king
        of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and
        dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth
        convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave
        him victuals and a reward, and let him go.

040:006 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;
        and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the
        land.

040:007 Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the
        fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of
        Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the
        land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children,
        and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried
        away captive to Babylon;

040:008 Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
        Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and
        Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the
        Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and
        their men.

040:009 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto
        them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the
        Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon,
        and it shall be well with you.

040:010 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the
        Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine,
        and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and
        dwell in your cities that ye have taken.

040:011 Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the
        Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries,
        heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah,
        and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the
        son of Shaphan;

040:012 Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were
        driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto
        Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.

040:013 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
        the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to
        Mizpah,

040:014 And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the
        king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
        to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them
        not.

040:015 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah
        secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay
        Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it:
        wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are
        gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in
        Judah perish?

040:016 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of
        Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest
        falsely of Ishmael.

041:001 Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
        of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the
        princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah
        the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread
        together in Mizpah.

041:002 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that
        were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of
        Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon
        had made governor over the land.

041:003 Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with
        Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there,
        and the men of war.

041:004 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain
        Gedaliah, and no man knew it,

041:005 That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from
        Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and
        their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings
        and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the
        LORD.

041:006 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to
        meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass,
        as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of
        Ahikam.

041:007 And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that
        Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the
        midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.

041:008 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay
        us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of
        barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them
        not among their brethren.

041:009 Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of
        the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which
        Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and
        Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were
        slain.

041:010 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the
        people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all
        the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the
        captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of
        Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away
        captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.

041:011 But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
        the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that
        Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,

041:012 Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the
        son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are
        in Gibeon.

041:013 Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with
        Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
        the forces that were with him, then they were glad.

041:014 So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from
        Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son
        of Kareah.

041:015 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with
        eight men, and went to the Ammonites.

041:016 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
        the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people
        whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from
        Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
        even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and
        the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:

041:017 And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham,
        which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,

041:018 Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them,
        because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the
        son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the
        land.

042:001 Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of
        Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people
        from the least even unto the greatest, came near,

042:002 And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our
        supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the
        LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but
        a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)

042:003 That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk,
        and the thing that we may do.

042:004 Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you;
        behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your
        words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the
        LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep
        nothing back from you.

042:005 Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful
        witness between us, if we do not even according to all things
        for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.

042:006 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the
        voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may
        be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.

042:007 And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD
        came unto Jeremiah.

042:008 Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains
        of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the
        least even to the greatest,

042:009 And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,
        unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;

042:010 If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you,
        and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you
        up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.

042:011 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid;
        be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to
        save you, and to deliver you from his hand.

042:012 And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon
        you, and cause you to return to your own land.

042:013 But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey
        the voice of the LORD your God,

042:014 Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we
        shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have
        hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:

042:015 And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of
        Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye
        wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn
        there;

042:016 Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared,
        shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine,
        whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in
        Egypt; and there ye shall die.

042:017 So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go
        into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by
        the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall
        remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.

042:018 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine
        anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when
        ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and
        an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see
        this place no more.

042:019 The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go
        ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you
        this day.

042:020 For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the
        LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and
        according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare
        unto us, and we will do it.

042:021 And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not
        obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the
        which he hath sent me unto you.

042:022 Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword,
        by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye
        desire to go and to sojourn.

043:001 And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of
        speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their
        God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even
        all these words,

043:002 Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of
        Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou
        speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say,
        Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:

043:003 But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for
        to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might
        put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.

043:004 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
        forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD,
        to dwell in the land of Judah.

043:005 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
        forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from
        all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the
        land of Judah;

043:006 Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters,
        and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had
        left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and
        Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.

043:007 So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the
        voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.

043:008 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,
        saying,

043:009 Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in
        the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in
        Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;

043:010 And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
        Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king
        of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these
        stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion
        over them.

043:011 And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and
        deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for
        captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the
        sword.

043:012 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt;
        and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he
        shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd
        putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in
        peace.

043:013 He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the
        land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians
        shall he burn with fire.

044:001 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which
        dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at
        Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,

044:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen
        all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all
        the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a
        desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,

044:003 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to
        provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to
        serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor
        your fathers.

044:004 Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
        early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable
        thing that I hate.

044:005 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from
        their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.

044:006 Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was
        kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of
        Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.

044:007 Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God
        of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your
        souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling,
        out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;

044:008 In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands,
        burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither
        ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and
        that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations
        of the earth?

044:009 Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the
        wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their
        wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your
        wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in
        the streets of Jerusalem?

044:010 They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they
        feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set
        before you and before your fathers.

044:011 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
        Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut
        off all Judah.

044:012 And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their
        faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they
        shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they
        shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they
        shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword
        and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an
        astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.

044:013 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I
        have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by
        the pestilence:

044:014 So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the
        land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that
        they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they
        have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return
        but such as shall escape.

044:015 Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned
        incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a
        great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of
        Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,

044:016 As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of
        the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.

044:017 But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of
        our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and
        to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and
        our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of
        Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty
        of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.

044:018 But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven,
        and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all
        things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.

044:019 And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured
        out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship
        her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?

044:020 Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the
        women, and to all the people which had given him that answer,
        saying,

044:021 The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the
        streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and
        your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD
        remember them, and came it not into his mind?

044:022 So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of
        your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have
        committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an
        astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this
        day.

044:023 Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned
        against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD,
        nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his
        testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at
        this day.

044:024 Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the
        women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the
        land of Egypt:

044:025 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye
        and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and
        fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our
        vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of
        heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will
        surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.

044:026 Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell
        in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name,
        saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the
        mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying,
        The Lord GOD liveth.

044:027 Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and
        all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be
        consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end
        of them.

044:028 Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of
        the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant
        of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn
        there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or their's.

044:029 And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will
        punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall
        surely stand against you for evil:

044:030 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of
        Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them
        that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the
        hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that
        sought his life.

045:001 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son
        of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the
        mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of
        Josiah king of Judah, saying,

045:002 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch:

045:003 Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief
        to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.

045:004 Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold,
        that which I have built will I break down, and that which I
        have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.

045:005 And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for,
        behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but
        thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places
        whither thou goest.

046:001 The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet
        against the Gentiles;

046:002 Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt,
        which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of
        Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.

046:003 Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.

046:004 Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth
        with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the
        brigandines.

046:005 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and
        their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and
        look not back: for fear was round about, saith the LORD.

046:006 Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they
        shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river
        Euphrates.

046:007 Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved
        as the rivers?

046:008 Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like
        the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the
        earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.

046:009 Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty
        men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle
        the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.

046:010 For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of
        vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the
        sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk
        with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice
        in the north country by the river Euphrates.

046:011 Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of
        Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt
        not be cured.

046:012 The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled
        the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty,
        and they are fallen both together.

046:013 The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land
        of Egypt.

046:014 Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in
        Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee;
        for the sword shall devour round about thee.

046:015 Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because
        the LORD did drive them.

046:016 He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they
        said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the
        land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.

046:017 They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he
        hath passed the time appointed.

046:018 As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts,
        Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the
        sea, so shall he come.

046:019 O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into
        captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an
        inhabitant.

046:020 Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it
        cometh out of the north.

046:021 Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted
        bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away
        together: they did not stand, because the day of their
        calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation.

046:022 The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall
        march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers
        of wood.

046:023 They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it
        cannot be searched; because they are more than the
        grasshoppers, and are innumerable.

046:024 The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be
        delivered into the hand of the people of the north.

046:025 The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will
        punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their
        gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust
        in him:

046:026 And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their
        lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
        and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be
        inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD.

046:027 But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O
        Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy
        seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return,
        and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.

046:028 Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am
        with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations
        whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of
        thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee
        wholly unpunished.

047:001 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
        the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.

047:002 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north,
        and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the
        land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell
        therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of
        the land shall howl.

047:003 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong
        horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of
        his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children
        for feebleness of hands;

047:004 Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines,
        and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that
        remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the
        remnant of the country of Caphtor.

047:005 Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the
        remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?

047:006 O thou sword of the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be
        quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.

047:007 How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge
        against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he
        appointed it.

048:001 Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
        Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and
        taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.

048:002 There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have
        devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from
        being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the
        sword shall pursue thee.

048:003 A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great
        destruction.

048:004 Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be
        heard.

048:005 For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up;
        for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry
        of destruction.

048:006 Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the
        wilderness.

048:007 For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy
        treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go
        forth into captivity with his priests and his princes
        together.

048:008 And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall
        escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be
        destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.

048:009 Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the
        cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell
        therein.

048:010 Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and
        cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.

048:011 Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on
        his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
        neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste
        remained in him, and his scent is not changed.

048:012 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
        send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and
        shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.

048:013 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel
        was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.

048:014 How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?

048:015 Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen
        young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King,
        whose name is the LORD of hosts.

048:016 The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction
        hasteth fast.

048:017 All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know
        his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the
        beautiful rod!

048:018 Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy
        glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come
        upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strong holds.

048:019 O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him
        that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?

048:020 Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell
        ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,

048:021 And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and
        upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,

048:022 And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,

048:023 And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,

048:024 And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of
        the land of Moab, far or near.

048:025 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the
        LORD.

048:026 Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the
        LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall
        be in derision.

048:027 For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among
        thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for
        joy.

048:028 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the
        rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides
        of the hole's mouth.

048:029 We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his
        loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the
        haughtiness of his heart.

048:030 I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his
        lies shall not so effect it.

048:031 Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all
        Moab; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.

048:032 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of
        Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to
        the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits
        and upon thy vintage.

048:033 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and
        from the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the
        winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting
        shall be no shouting.

048:034 From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto
        Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto
        Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also
        of Nimrim shall be desolate.

048:035 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him
        that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense
        to his gods.

048:036 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine
        heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because
        the riches that he hath gotten are perished.

048:037 For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon
        all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.

048:038 There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of
        Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like
        a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.

048:039 They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab
        turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a
        dismaying to all them about him.

048:040 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and
        shall spread his wings over Moab.

048:041 Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the
        mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart
        of a woman in her pangs.

048:042 And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he
        hath magnified himself against the LORD.

048:043 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O
        inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.

048:044 He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he
        that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare:
        for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their
        visitation, saith the LORD.

048:045 They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of
        the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a
        flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of
        Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.

048:046 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for
        thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.

048:047 Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter
        days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

049:001 Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no
        sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad,
        and his people dwell in his cities?

049:002 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
        cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites;
        and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be
        burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that
        were his heirs, saith the LORD.

049:003 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of
        Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by
        the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his
        priests and his princes together.

049:004 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O
        backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying,
        Who shall come unto me?

049:005 Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of
        hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be
        driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him
        that wandereth.

049:006 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children
        of Ammon, saith the LORD.

049:007 Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no
        more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their
        wisdom vanished?

049:008 Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I
        will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will
        visit him.

049:009 If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some
        gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till
        they have enough.

049:010 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places,
        and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled,
        and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.

049:011 Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and
        let thy widows trust in me.

049:012 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not
        to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he
        that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go
        unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.

049:013 For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall
        become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all
        the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.

049:014 I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent
        unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against
        her, and rise up to the battle.

049:015 For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and
        despised among men.

049:016 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine
        heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that
        holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy
        nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence,
        saith the LORD.

049:017 Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it
        shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues
        thereof.

049:018 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
        cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there,
        neither shall a son of man dwell in it.

049:019 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of
        Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will
        suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man,
        that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will
        appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand
        before me?

049:020 Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken
        against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against
        the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall
        draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate
        with them.

049:021 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the
        noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.

049:022 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his
        wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the
        mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.

049:023 Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they
        have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is
        sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.

049:024 Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and
        fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her,
        as a woman in travail.

049:025 How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!

049:026 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the
        men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of
        hosts.

049:027 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall
        consume the palaces of Benhadad.

049:028 Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the
        LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.

049:029 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall
        take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and
        their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every
        side.

049:030 Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor,
        saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken
        counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.

049:031 Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth
        without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor
        bars, which dwell alone.

049:032 And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their
        cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that
        are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity
        from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.

049:033 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation
        for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man
        dwell in it.

049:034 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
        Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah,
        saying,

049:035 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of
        Elam, the chief of their might.

049:036 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four
        quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those
        winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of
        Elam shall not come.

049:037 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and
        before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon
        them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send
        the sword after them, till I have consumed them:

049:038 And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence
        the king and the princes, saith the LORD.

049:039 But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will
        bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.

050:001 The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the
        land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.

050:002 Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a
        standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel
        is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are
        confounded, her images are broken in pieces.

050:003 For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her,
        which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell
        therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and
        beast.

050:004 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children
        of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together,
        going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.

050:005 They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,
        saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a
        perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.

050:006 My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused
        them to go astray, they have turned them away on the
        mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have
        forgotten their restingplace.

050:007 All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries
        said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the
        LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of
        their fathers.

050:008 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the
        land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the
        flocks.

050:009 For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an
        assembly of great nations from the north country: and they
        shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she
        shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert
        man; none shall return in vain.

050:010 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be
        satisfied, saith the LORD.

050:011 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of
        mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at
        grass, and bellow as bulls;

050:012 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall
        be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a
        wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.

050:013 Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited,
        but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by
        Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.

050:014 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye
        that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath
        sinned against the LORD.

050:015 Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her
        foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is
        the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she
        hath done, do unto her.

050:016 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the
        sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing
        sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall
        flee every one to his own land.

050:017 Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away:
        first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.

050:018 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
        Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I
        have punished the king of Assyria.

050:019 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall
        feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied
        upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.

050:020 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity
        of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and
        the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will
        pardon them whom I reserve.

050:021 Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and
        against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy
        after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I
        have commanded thee.

050:022 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.

050:023 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken!
        how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!

050:024 I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O
        Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also
        caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.

050:025 The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the
        weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord
        GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.

050:026 Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses:
        cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of
        her be left.

050:027 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe
        unto them! for their day is come, the time of their
        visitation.

050:028 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of
        Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God,
        the vengeance of his temple.

050:029 Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend
        the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape:
        recompense her according to her work; according to all that
        she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against
        the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.

050:030 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her
        men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.

050:031 Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord
        GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit
        thee.

050:032 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall
        raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it
        shall devour all round about him.

050:033 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the
        children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took
        them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.

050:034 Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he
        shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to
        the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.

050:035 A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the
        inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her
        wise men.

050:036 A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is
        upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.

050:037 A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and
        upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and
        they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and
        they shall be robbed.

050:038 A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for
        it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their
        idols.

050:039 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts
        of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell
        therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither
        shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.

050:040 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities
        thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither
        shall any son of man dwell therein.

050:041 Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great
        nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of
        the earth.

050:042 They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and
        will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and
        they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a
        man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.

050:043 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his
        hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of
        a woman in travail.

050:044 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of
        Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them
        suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I
        may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint
        me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before
        me?

050:045 Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken
        against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed
        against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the
        flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their
        habitation desolate with them.

050:046 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and
        the cry is heard among the nations.

051:001 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon,
        and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up
        against me, a destroying wind;

051:002 And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and
        shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be
        against her round about.

051:003 Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and
        against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and
        spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.

051:004 Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and
        they that are thrust through in her streets.

051:005 For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of
        the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin
        against the Holy One of Israel.

051:006 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his
        soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of
        the LORD's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.

051:007 Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made
        all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine;
        therefore the nations are mad.

051:008 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take
        balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.

051:009 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake
        her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her
        judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the
        skies.

051:010 The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let
        us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.

051:011 Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath
        raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device
        is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance
        of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.

051:012 Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch
        strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the
        LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against
        the inhabitants of Babylon.

051:013 O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures,
        thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.

051:014 The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will
        fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift
        up a shout against thee.

051:015 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
        world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his
        understanding.

051:016 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in
        the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the
        ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and
        bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.

051:017 Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is
        confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is
        falsehood, and there is no breath in them.

051:018 They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their
        visitation they shall perish.

051:019 The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of
        all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD
        of hosts is his name.

051:020 Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will
        I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy
        kingdoms;

051:021 And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;
        and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his
        rider;

051:022 With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with
        thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will
        I break in pieces the young man and the maid;

051:023 I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his
        flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and
        his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces
        captains and rulers.

051:024 And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of
        Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your
        sight, saith the LORD.

051:025 Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the
        LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out
        mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and
        will make thee a burnt mountain.

051:026 And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a
        stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever,
        saith the LORD.

051:027 Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the
        nations, prepare the nations against her, call together
        against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz;
        appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as
        the rough caterpillers.

051:028 Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes,
        the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the
        land of his dominion.

051:029 And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of
        the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land
        of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.

051:030 The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have
        remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became
        as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are
        broken.

051:031 One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet
        another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at
        one end,

051:032 And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have
        burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.

051:033 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The
        daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to
        thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest
        shall come.

051:034 Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath
        crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed
        me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my
        delicates, he hath cast me out.

051:035 The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall
        the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants
        of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.

051:036 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause,
        and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and
        make her springs dry.

051:037 And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons,
        an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.

051:038 They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions'
        whelps.

051:039 In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them
        drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep,
        and not wake, saith the LORD.

051:040 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams
        with he goats.

051:041 How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole
        earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among
        the nations!

051:042 The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the
        multitude of the waves thereof.

051:043 Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a
        land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass
        thereby.

051:044 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out
        of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations
        shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of
        Babylon shall fall.

051:045 My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every
        man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.

051:046 And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that
        shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year,
        and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and
        violence in the land, ruler against ruler.

051:047 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon
        the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be
        confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.

051:048 Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall
        sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from
        the north, saith the LORD.

051:049 As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at
        Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.

051:050 Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still:
        remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your
        mind.

051:051 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath
        covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries
        of the LORD's house.

051:052 Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
        do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land
        the wounded shall groan.

051:053 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she
        should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall
        spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.

051:054 A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction
        from the land of the Chaldeans:

051:055 Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of
        her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters,
        a noise of their voice is uttered:

051:056 Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and
        her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken:
        for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.

051:057 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her
        captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall
        sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose
        name is the LORD of hosts.

051:058 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall
        be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with
        fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the
        fire, and they shall be weary.

051:059 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son
        of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the
        king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign.
        And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.

051:060 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon
        Babylon, even all these words that are written against
        Babylon.

051:061 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and
        shalt see, and shalt read all these words;

051:062 Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this
        place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither
        man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.

051:063 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this
        book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the
        midst of Euphrates:

051:064 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not
        rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall
        be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

052:001 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

052:002 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD,
        according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

052:003 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
        and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that
        Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

052:004 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the
        tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army,
        against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts
        against it round about.

052:005 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
        Zedekiah.

052:006 And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the
        famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for
        the people of the land.

052:007 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and
        went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate
        between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now
        the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by
        the way of the plain.

052:008 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and
        overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army
        was scattered from him.

052:009 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of
        Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave
        judgment upon him.

052:010 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his
        eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.

052:011 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon
        bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him
        in prison till the day of his death.

052:012 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which
        was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
        came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king
        of Babylon, into Jerusalem,

052:013 And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and
        all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great
        men, burned he with fire:

052:014 And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain
        of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round
        about.

052:015 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
        certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the
        people that remained in the city, and those that fell away,
        that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the
        multitude.

052:016 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the
        poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.

052:017 Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD,
        and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the
        LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them
        to Babylon.

052:018 The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the
        bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith
        they ministered, took they away.

052:019 And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the
        caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups;
        that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver
        in silver, took the captain of the guard away.

052:020 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were
        under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of
        the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.

052:021 And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was
        eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it;
        and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.

052:022 And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one
        chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon
        the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar
        also and the pomegranates were like unto these.

052:023 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all
        the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.

052:024 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
        and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the
        door:

052:025 He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge
        of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the
        king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal
        scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and
        threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in
        the midst of the city.

052:026 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought
        them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.

052:027 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in
        Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away
        captive out of his own land.

052:028 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive:
        in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:

052:029 In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away
        captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:

052:030 In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan
        the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews
        seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were
        four thousand and six hundred.

052:031 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
        captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,
        in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach
        king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the
        head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of
        prison.

052:032 And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne
        of the kings that were with him in Babylon,

052:033 And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat
        bread before him all the days of his life.

052:034 And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the
        king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his
        death, all the days of his life.

Book 25	Lamentations

001:001 How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how
        is she become as a widow! she that was great among the
        nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become
        tributary!

001:002 She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her
        cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all
        her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become
        her enemies.

001:003 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and
        because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen,
        she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between
        the straits.

001:004 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn
        feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her
        virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.

001:005 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the
        LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her
        transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before
        the enemy.

001:006 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her
        princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they
        are gone without strength before the pursuer.

001:007 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her
        miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of
        old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none
        did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her
        sabbaths.

001:008 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed:
        all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her
        nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.

001:009 Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last
        end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no
        comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath
        magnified himself.

001:010 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant
        things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her
        sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter
        into thy congregation.

001:011 All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their
        pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and
        consider; for I am become vile.

001:012 Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if
        there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto
        me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his
        fierce anger.

001:013 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth
        against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned
        me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.

001:014 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are
        wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength
        to fall, the LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from
        whom I am not able to rise up.

001:015 The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the
        midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my
        young men: the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of
        Judah, as in a winepress.

001:016 For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with
        water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is
        far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy
        prevailed.

001:017 Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort
        her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his
        adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a
        menstruous woman among them.

001:018 The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his
        commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my
        sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.

001:019 I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and
        mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought
        their meat to relieve their souls.

001:020 Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled;
        mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously
        rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as
        death.

001:021 They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all
        mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou
        hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called,
        and they shall be like unto me.

001:022 Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them,
        as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my
        sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

002:001 How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in
        his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty
        of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his
        anger!

002:002 The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and
        hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong
        holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to
        the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes
        thereof.

002:003 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he
        hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he
        burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth
        round about.

002:004 He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right
        hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the
        eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out
        his fury like fire.

002:005 The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath
        swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong
        holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning
        and lamentation.

002:006 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were
        of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the
        LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be
        forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his
        anger the king and the priest.

002:007 The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his
        sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the
        walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of
        the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.

002:008 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
        Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his
        hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the
        wall to lament; they languished together.

002:009 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and
        broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the
        Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision
        from the LORD.

002:010 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and
        keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they
        have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of
        Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.

002:011 Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver
        is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter
        of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in
        the streets of the city.

002:012 They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they
        swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their
        soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.

002:013 What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall
        I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal
        to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?
        for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?

002:014 Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and
        they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy
        captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of
        banishment.

002:015 All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag
        their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the
        city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the
        whole earth?

002:016 All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they
        hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up:
        certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found,
        we have seen it.

002:017 The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath
        fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old:
        he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused
        thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of
        thine adversaries.

002:018 Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of
        Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give
        thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.

002:019 Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches
        pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD:
        lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young
        children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.

002:020 Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this.
        Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long?
        shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of
        the Lord?

002:021 The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my
        virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast
        slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and
        not pitied.

002:022 Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so
        that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained:
        those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy
        consumed.

003:001 I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his
        wrath.

003:002 He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into
        light.

003:003 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me
        all the day.

003:004 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my
        bones.

003:005 He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and
        travail.

003:006 He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.

003:007 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made
        my chain heavy.

003:008 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.

003:009 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my
        paths crooked.

003:010 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in
        secret places.

003:011 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath
        made me desolate.

003:012 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.

003:013 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my
        reins.

003:014 I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.

003:015 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken
        with wormwood.

003:016 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath
        covered me with ashes.

003:017 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat
        prosperity.

003:018 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:

003:019 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and
        the gall.

003:020 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.

003:021 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

003:022 It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because
        his compassions fail not.

003:023 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.

003:024 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope
        in him.

003:025 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that
        seeketh him.

003:026 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for
        the salvation of the LORD.

003:027 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.

003:028 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it
        upon him.

003:029 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.

003:030 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full
        with reproach.

003:031 For the LORD will not cast off for ever:

003:032 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion
        according to the multitude of his mercies.

003:033 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of
        men.

003:034 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.

003:035 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most
        High,

003:036 To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.

003:037 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord
        commandeth it not?

003:038 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and
        good?

003:039 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment
        of his sins?

003:040 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.

003:041 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the
        heavens.

003:042 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not
        pardoned.

003:043 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast
        slain, thou hast not pitied.

003:044 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should
        not pass through.

003:045 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst
        of the people.

003:046 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.

003:047 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.

003:048 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction
        of the daughter of my people.

003:049 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any
        intermission.

003:050 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.

003:051 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of
        my city.

003:052 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.

003:053 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone
        upon me.

003:054 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.

003:055 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.

003:056 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing,
        at my cry.

003:057 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou
        saidst, Fear not.

003:058 O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast
        redeemed my life.

003:059 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.

003:060 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations
        against me.

003:061 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their
        imaginations against me;

003:062 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device
        against me all the day.

003:063 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their
        musick.

003:064 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work
        of their hands.

003:065 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.

003:066 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of
        the LORD.

004:001 How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed!
        the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every
        street.

004:002 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are
        they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of
        the potter!

004:003 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to
        their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel,
        like the ostriches in the wilderness.

004:004 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his
        mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man
        breaketh it unto them.

004:005 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets:
        they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.

004:006 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my
        people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom,
        that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on
        her.

004:007 Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than
        milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their
        polishing was of sapphire:

004:008 Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the
        streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered,
        it is become like a stick.

004:009 They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be
        slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for
        want of the fruits of the field.

004:010 The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:
        they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my
        people.

004:011 The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his
        fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath
        devoured the foundations thereof.

004:012 The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,
        would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy
        should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.

004:013 For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her
        priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of
        her,

004:014 They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have
        polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch
        their garments.

004:015 They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart,
        depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said
        among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.

004:016 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more
        regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests,
        they favoured not the elders.

004:017 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our
        watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.

004:018 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end
        is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.

004:019 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven:
        they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in
        the wilderness.

004:020 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was
        taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we
        shall live among the heathen.

004:021 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the
        land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou
        shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.

004:022 The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter
        of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he
        will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will
        discover thy sins.

005:001 Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold
        our reproach.

005:002 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.

005:003 We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.

005:004 We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.

005:005 Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.

005:006 We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians,
        to be satisfied with bread.

005:007 Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their
        iniquities.

005:008 Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver
        us out of their hand.

005:009 We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the
        sword of the wilderness.

005:010 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible
        famine.

005:011 They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities
        of Judah.

005:012 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were
        not honoured.

005:013 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under
        the wood.

005:014 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their
        musick.

005:015 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into
        mourning.

005:016 The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have
        sinned!

005:017 For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are
        dim.

005:018 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes
        walk upon it.

005:019 Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation
        to generation.

005:020 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long
        time?

005:021 Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew
        our days as of old.

005:022 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against
        us.

Book 26	Ezekiel

001:001 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth
        month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the
        captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened,
        and I saw visions of God.

001:002 In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of
        king Jehoiachin's captivity,

001:003 The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest,
        the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river
        Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.

001:004 And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north,
        a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness
        was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of
        amber, out of the midst of the fire.

001:005 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living
        creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the
        likeness of a man.

001:006 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.

001:007 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet
        was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the
        colour of burnished brass.

001:008 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their
        four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.

001:009 Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when
        they went; they went every one straight forward.

001:010 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of
        a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they
        four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also
        had the face of an eagle.

001:011 Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward;
        two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two
        covered their bodies.

001:012 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit
        was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.

001:013 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance
        was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of
        lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the
        fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.

001:014 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of
        a flash of lightning.

001:015 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon
        the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.

001:016 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the
        colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their
        appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle
        of a wheel.

001:017 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they
        turned not when they went.

001:018 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful;
        and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.

001:019 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them:
        and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth,
        the wheels were lifted up.

001:020 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was
        their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against
        them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

001:021 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these
        stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the
        wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the
        living creature was in the wheels.

001:022 And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
        creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched
        forth over their heads above.

001:023 And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one
        toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this
        side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their
        bodies.

001:024 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the
        noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice
        of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let
        down their wings.

001:025 And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their
        heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.

001:026 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the
        likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone:
        and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the
        appearance of a man above upon it.

001:027 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire
        round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even
        upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I
        saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness
        round about.

001:028 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day
        of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.
        This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the
        LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a
        voice of one that spake.

002:001 And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I
        will speak unto thee.

002:002 And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set
        me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.

002:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children
        of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against
        me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even
        unto this very day.

002:004 For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send
        thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the
        Lord GOD.

002:005 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will
        forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know
        that there hath been a prophet among them.

002:006 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid
        of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and
        thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words,
        nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious
        house.

002:007 And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will
        hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most
        rebellious.

002:008 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou
        rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat
        that I give thee.

002:009 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo,
        a roll of a book was therein;

002:010 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and
        without: and there was written therein lamentations, and
        mourning, and woe.

003:001 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest;
        eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.

003:002 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.

003:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and
        fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I
        eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.

003:004 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house
        of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.

003:005 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of
        an hard language, but to the house of Israel;

003:006 Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard
        language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I
        sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.

003:007 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they
        will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are
        impudent and hardhearted.

003:008 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and
        thy forehead strong against their foreheads.

003:009 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear
        them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a
        rebellious house.

003:010 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I
        shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with
        thine ears.

003:011 And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children
        of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith
        the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will
        forbear.

003:012 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a
        great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from
        his place.

003:013 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures
        that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over
        against them, and a noise of a great rushing.

003:014 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in
        bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD
        was strong upon me.

003:015 Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by
        the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained
        there astonished among them seven days.

003:016 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of
        the LORD came unto me, saying,

003:017 Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of
        Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them
        warning from me.

003:018 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou
        givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from
        his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall
        die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine
        hand.

003:019 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his
        wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his
        iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.

003:020 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness,
        and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him,
        he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he
        shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done
        shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine
        hand.

003:021 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the
        righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live,
        because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.

003:022 And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto
        me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with
        thee.

003:023 Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the
        glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the
        river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.

003:024 Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and
        spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine
        house.

003:025 But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon
        thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out
        among them:

003:026 And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth,
        that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover:
        for they are a rebellious house.

003:027 But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou
        shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth,
        let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for
        they are a rebellious house.

004:001 Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before
        thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem:

004:002 And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and
        cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set
        battering rams against it round about.

004:003 Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a
        wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face
        against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege
        against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.

004:004 Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the
        house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days
        that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.

004:005 For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity,
        according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety
        days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

004:006 And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right
        side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah
        forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.

004:007 Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of
        Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt
        prophesy against it.

004:008 And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not
        turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the
        days of thy siege.

004:009 Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and
        lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel,
        and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the
        days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and
        ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.

004:010 And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty
        shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.

004:011 Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an
        hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.

004:012 And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it
        with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.

004:013 And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat
        their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive
        them.

004:014 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been
        polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten
        of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither
        came there abominable flesh into my mouth.

004:015 Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for
        man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.

004:016 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the
        staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by
        weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure,
        and with astonishment:

004:017 That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with
        another, and consume away for their iniquity.

005:001 And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a
        barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon
        thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the
        hair.

005:002 Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the
        city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt
        take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a
        third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out
        a sword after them.

005:003 Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in
        thy skirts.

005:004 Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the
        fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come
        forth into all the house of Israel.

005:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in
        the midst of the nations and countries that are round about
        her.

005:006 And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than
        the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are
        round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my
        statutes, they have not walked in them.

005:007 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more
        than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked
        in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have
        done according to the judgments of the nations that are round
        about you;

005:008 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am
        against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee
        in the sight of the nations.

005:009 And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and
        whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all
        thine abominations.

005:010 Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee,
        and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute
        judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I
        scatter into all the winds.

005:011 Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou
        hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and
        with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish
        thee; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any
        pity.

005:012 A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with
        famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a
        third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I
        will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw
        out a sword after them.

005:013 Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my
        fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they
        shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I
        have accomplished my fury in them.

005:014 Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the
        nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that
        pass by.

005:015 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an
        astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when
        I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in
        furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.

005:016 When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which
        shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to
        destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will
        break your staff of bread:

005:017 So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall
        bereave thee: and pestilence and blood shall pass through
        thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have
        spoken it.

006:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

006:002 Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and
        prophesy against them,

006:003 And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord
        GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the
        hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I,
        will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high
        places.

006:004 And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be
        broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.

006:005 And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel
        before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about
        your altars.

006:006 In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and
        the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be
        laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and
        cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be
        abolished.

006:007 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall
        know that I am the LORD.

006:008 Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall
        escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered
        through the countries.

006:009 And they that escape of you shall remember me among the
        nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am
        broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me,
        and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and
        they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have
        committed in all their abominations.

006:010 And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not
        said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.

006:011 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with
        thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the
        house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the
        famine, and by the pestilence.

006:012 He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is
        near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is
        besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my
        fury upon them.

006:013 Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men
        shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon
        every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under
        every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where
        they did offer sweet savour to all their idols.

006:014 So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land
        desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward
        Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I
        am the LORD.

007:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

007:002 Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land
        of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of
        the land.

007:003 Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon
        thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will
        recompense upon thee all thine abominations.

007:004 And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity:
        but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine
        abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know
        that I am the LORD.

007:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is
        come.

007:006 An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold,
        it is come.

007:007 The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the
        land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not
        the sounding again of the mountains.

007:008 Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish
        mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy
        ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.

007:009 And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will
        recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations
        that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the
        LORD that smiteth.

007:010 Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth;
        the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.

007:011 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them
        shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of their's:
        neither shall there be wailing for them.

007:012 The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer
        rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the
        multitude thereof.

007:013 For the seller shall not return to that which is sold,
        although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the
        whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall
        any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.

007:014 They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none
        goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude
        thereof.

007:015 The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine
        within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and
        he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour
        him.

007:016 But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the
        mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning,
        every one for his iniquity.

007:017 All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as
        water.

007:018 They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror
        shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and
        baldness upon all their heads.

007:019 They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold
        shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be
        able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they
        shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels:
        because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.

007:020 As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but
        they made the images of their abominations and of their
        detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from
        them.

007:021 And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey,
        and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall
        pollute it.

007:022 My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my
        secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile
        it.

007:023 Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the
        city is full of violence.

007:024 Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they
        shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the
        strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.

007:025 Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall
        be none.

007:026 Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon
        rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the
        law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the
        ancients.

007:027 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with
        desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be
        troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according
        to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I
        am the LORD.

008:001 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in
        the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the
        elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD
        fell there upon me.

008:002 Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire:
        from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from
        his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the
        colour of amber.

008:003 And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of
        mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and
        the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem,
        to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north;
        where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh
        to jealousy.

008:004 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there,
        according to the vision that I saw in the plain.

008:005 Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the
        way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward
        the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this
        image of jealousy in the entry.

008:006 He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they
        do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel
        committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary?
        but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater
        abominations.

008:007 And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
        behold a hole in the wall.

008:008 Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and
        when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.

008:009 And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations
        that they do here.

008:010 So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping
        things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house
        of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.

008:011 And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the
        house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the
        son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a
        thick cloud of incense went up.

008:012 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
        ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in
        the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD seeth us
        not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.

008:013 He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see
        greater abominations that they do.

008:014 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house
        which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women
        weeping for Tammuz.

008:015 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn
        thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than
        these.

008:016 And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house,
        and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between
        the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with
        their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces
        toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.

008:017 Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it
        a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the
        abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the
        land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger:
        and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.

008:018 Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare,
        neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears
        with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.

009:001 He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause
        them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every
        man with his destroying weapon in his hand.

009:002 And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate,
        which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon
        in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen,
        with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and
        stood beside the brasen altar.

009:003 And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the
        cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And
        he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the
        writer's inkhorn by his side;

009:004 And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city,
        through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the
        foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the
        abominations that be done in the midst thereof.

009:005 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him
        through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither
        have ye pity:

009:006 Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children,
        and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark;
        and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men
        which were before the house.

009:007 And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts
        with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in
        the city.

009:008 And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was
        left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord
        GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy
        pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?

009:009 Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and
        Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and
        the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath
        forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.

009:010 And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I
        have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.

009:011 And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn
        by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou
        hast commanded me.

010:001 Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above
        the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were
        a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a
        throne.

010:002 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in
        between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand
        with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter
        them over the city. And he went in in my sight.

010:003 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when
        the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.

010:004 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood
        over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with
        the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the
        LORD's glory.

010:005 And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the
        outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he
        speaketh.

010:006 And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man
        clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels,
        from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside
        the wheels.

010:007 And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the
        cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and
        took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was
        clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.

010:008 And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand
        under their wings.

010:009 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims,
        one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub:
        and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl
        stone.

010:010 And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as
        if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.

010:011 When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned
        not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked
        they followed it; they turned not as they went.

010:012 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and
        their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about,
        even the wheels that they four had.

010:013 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O
        wheel.

010:014 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a
        cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the
        third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

010:015 And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature
        that I saw by the river of Chebar.

010:016 And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when
        the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the
        earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.

010:017 When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up,
        these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living
        creature was in them.

010:018 Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of
        the house, and stood over the cherubims.

010:019 And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from
        the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also
        were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east
        gate of the LORD's house; and the glory of the God of Israel
        was over them above.

010:020 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel
        by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the
        cherubims.

010:021 Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and
        the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.

010:022 And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw
        by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they
        went every one straight forward.

011:001 Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east
        gate of the LORD's house, which looketh eastward: and behold
        at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw
        Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah,
        princes of the people.

011:002 Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that
        devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:

011:003 Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is
        the caldron, and we be the flesh.

011:004 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.

011:005 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me,
        Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of
        Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every
        one of them.

011:006 Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled
        the streets thereof with the slain.

011:007 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have
        laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is
        the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of
        it.

011:008 Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,
        saith the Lord GOD.

011:009 And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you
        into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among
        you.

011:010 Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of
        Israel; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

011:011 This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the
        flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border
        of Israel:

011:012 And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked
        in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done
        after the manners of the heathen that are round about you.

011:013 And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son
        of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with
        a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end
        of the remnant of Israel?

011:014 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

011:015 Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy
        kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto
        whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from
        the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.

011:016 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast
        them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered
        them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little
        sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.

011:017 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you
        from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where
        ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of
        Israel.

011:018 And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the
        detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof
        from thence.

011:019 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit
        within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their
        flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:

011:020 That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances,
        and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their
        God.

011:021 But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their
        detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense
        their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.

011:022 Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels
        beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them
        above.

011:023 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city,
        and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the
        city.

011:024 Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision
        by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity.
        So the vision that I had seen went up from me.

011:025 Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that
        the LORD had shewed me.

012:001 The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,

012:002 Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house,
        which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear,
        and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.

012:003 Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing,
        and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from
        thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will
        consider, though they be a rebellious house.

012:004 Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight,
        as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in
        their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.

012:005 Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out
        thereby.

012:006 In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and
        carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face,
        that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign
        unto the house of Israel.

012:007 And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by
        day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through
        the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight,
        and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.

012:008 And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

012:009 Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious
        house, said unto thee, What doest thou?

012:010 Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden
        concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of
        Israel that are among them.

012:011 Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done
        unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.

012:012 And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder
        in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through
        the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that
        he see not the ground with his eyes.

012:013 My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in
        my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the
        Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.

012:014 And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to
        help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword
        after them.

012:015 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter
        them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.

012:016 But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the
        famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all
        their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and
        they shall know that I am the LORD.

012:017 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

012:018 Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water
        with trembling and with carefulness;

012:019 And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD
        of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel;
        They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their
        water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from
        all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that
        dwell therein.

012:020 And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the
        land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

012:021 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

012:022 Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of
        Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision
        faileth?

012:023 Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this
        proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb
        in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the
        effect of every vision.

012:024 For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering
        divination within the house of Israel.

012:025 For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall
        speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for
        in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and
        will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.

012:026 Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.

012:027 Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The
        vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he
        prophesieth of the times that are far off.

012:028 Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall
        none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I
        have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.

013:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

013:002 Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that
        prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their
        own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;

013:003 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that
        follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!

013:004 O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.

013:005 Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge
        for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of
        the LORD.

013:006 They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD
        saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made
        others to hope that they would confirm the word.

013:007 Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying
        divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have
        not spoken?

013:008 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken
        vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you,
        saith the Lord GOD.

013:009 And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and
        that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my
        people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the
        house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of
        Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

013:010 Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying,
        Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and,
        lo, others daubed it with untempered morter:

013:011 Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it
        shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O
        great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.

013:012 Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you,
        Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?

013:013 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a
        stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing
        shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to
        consume it.

013:014 So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with
        untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that
        the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall,
        and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall
        know that I am the LORD.

013:015 Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them
        that have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto
        you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;

013:016 To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning
        Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there
        is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.

013:017 Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters
        of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and
        prophesy thou against them,

013:018 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew
        pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of
        every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my
        people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?

013:019 And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley
        and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not
        die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your
        lying to my people that hear your lies?

013:020 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your
        pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly,
        and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls
        go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.

013:021 Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of
        your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be
        hunted; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

013:022 Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad,
        whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the
        wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by
        promising him life:

013:023 Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations:
        for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall
        know that I am the LORD.

014:001 Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat
        before me.

014:002 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

014:003 Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart,
        and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their
        face: should I be enquired of at all by them?

014:004 Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the
        Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his
        idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his
        iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the
        LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of
        his idols;

014:005 That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart,
        because they are all estranged from me through their idols.

014:006 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
        GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn
        away your faces from all your abominations.

014:007 For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that
        sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and
        setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the
        stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to
        a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will
        answer him by myself:

014:008 And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a
        sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of
        my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

014:009 And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I
        the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my
        hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my
        people Israel.

014:010 And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the
        punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of
        him that seeketh unto him;

014:011 That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me,
        neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions;
        but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith
        the Lord GOD.

014:012 The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,

014:013 Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing
        grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and
        will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send
        famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:

014:014 Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it,
        they should deliver but their own souls by their
        righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.

014:015 If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they
        spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through
        because of the beasts:

014:016 Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord
        GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only
        shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.

014:017 Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go
        through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:

014:018 Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord
        GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they
        only shall be delivered themselves.

014:019 Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury
        upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:

014:020 Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the
        Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they
        shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.

014:021 For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four
        sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and
        the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man
        and beast?

014:022 Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be
        brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall
        come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their
        doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I
        have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have
        brought upon it.

014:023 And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their
        doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause
        all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.

015:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

015:002 Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, or than
        a branch which is among the trees of the forest?

015:003 Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a
        pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?

015:004 Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth
        both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet
        for any work?

015:005 Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much
        less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath
        devoured it, and it is burned?

015:006 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the
        trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel,
        so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

015:007 And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from
        one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall
        know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.

015:008 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed
        a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.

016:001 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

016:002 Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,

016:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and
        thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an
        Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.

016:004 And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel
        was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee;
        thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.

016:005 None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have
        compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open
        field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast
        born.

016:006 And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own
        blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live;
        yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.

016:007 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and
        thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to
        excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair
        is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare.

016:008 Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy
        time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee,
        and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered
        into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou
        becamest mine.

016:009 Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away
        thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.

016:010 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with
        badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I
        covered thee with silk.

016:011 I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon
        thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.

016:012 And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears,
        and a beautiful crown upon thine head.

016:013 Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment
        was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst
        eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding
        beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.

016:014 And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty:
        for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon
        thee, saith the Lord GOD.

016:015 But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the
        harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy
        fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.

016:016 And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high
        places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon:
        the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.

016:017 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
        silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images
        of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,

016:018 And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and
        thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.

016:019 My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and
        honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them
        for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.

016:020 Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou
        hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them
        to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,

016:021 That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause
        them to pass through the fire for them?

016:022 And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not
        remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and
        bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.

016:023 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto
        thee! saith the LORD GOD;)

016:024 That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast
        made thee an high place in every street.

016:025 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and
        hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet
        to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.

016:026 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
        neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms,
        to provoke me to anger.

016:027 Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and
        have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto
        the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the
        Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.

016:028 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because
        thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with
        them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.

016:029 Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of
        Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied
        therewith.

016:030 How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest
        all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;

016:031 In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every
        way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not
        been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;

016:032 But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers
        instead of her husband!

016:033 They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to
        all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee
        on every side for thy whoredom.

016:034 And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms,
        whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that
        thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee,
        therefore thou art contrary.

016:035 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:

016:036 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured
        out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with
        thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by
        the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;

016:037 Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou
        hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with
        all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round
        about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them,
        that they may see all thy nakedness.

016:038 And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed
        blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and
        jealousy.

016:039 And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall
        throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high
        places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall
        take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.

016:040 They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they
        shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with
        their swords.

016:041 And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute
        judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will
        cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also
        shalt give no hire any more.

016:042 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy
        shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no
        more angry.

016:043 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but
        hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also
        will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD:
        and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine
        abominations.

016:044 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb
        against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.

016:045 Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and
        her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which
        lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an
        Hittite, and your father an Amorite.

016:046 And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that
        dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth
        at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.

016:047 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after
        their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing,
        thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.

016:048 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done,
        she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy
        daughters.

016:049 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride,
        fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in
        her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor
        and needy.

016:050 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
        therefore I took them away as I saw good.

016:051 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast
        multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast
        justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou
        hast done.

016:052 Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame
        for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than
        they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou
        confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast
        justified thy sisters.

016:053 When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of
        Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her
        daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy
        captives in the midst of them:

016:054 That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be
        confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a
        comfort unto them.

016:055 When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to
        their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall
        return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters
        shall return to your former estate.

016:056 For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day
        of thy pride,

016:057 Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy
        reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round
        about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise
        thee round about.

016:058 Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the
        LORD.

016:059 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as
        thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the
        covenant.

016:060 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days
        of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting
        covenant.

016:061 Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou
        shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I
        will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy
        covenant.

016:062 And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt
        know that I am the LORD:

016:063 That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open
        thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified
        toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.

017:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

017:002 Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the
        house of Israel;

017:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great
        wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours,
        came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:

017:004 He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into
        a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.

017:005 He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a
        fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a
        willow tree.

017:006 And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose
        branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under
        him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot
        forth sprigs.

017:007 There was also another great eagle with great wings and many
        feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward
        him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might
        water it by the furrows of her plantation.

017:008 It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might
        bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it
        might be a goodly vine.

017:009 Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he
        not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof,
        that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her
        spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up
        by the roots thereof.

017:010 Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not
        utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall
        wither in the furrows where it grew.

017:011 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

017:012 Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things
        mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to
        Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes
        thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;

017:013 And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with
        him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the
        mighty of the land:

017:014 That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself
        up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.

017:015 But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into
        Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall
        he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall
        he break the covenant, and be delivered?

017:016 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the
        king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and
        whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon
        he shall die.

017:017 Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company
        make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building
        forts, to cut off many persons:

017:018 Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when,
        lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he
        shall not escape.

017:019 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath
        that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken,
        even it will I recompense upon his own head.

017:020 And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my
        snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with
        him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.

017:021 And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the
        sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all
        winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.

017:022 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest
        branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off
        from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant
        it upon an high mountain and eminent:

017:023 In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and
        it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly
        cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the
        shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.

017:024 And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have
        brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have
        dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to
        flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.

018:001 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

018:002 What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of
        Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the
        children's teeth are set on edge?

018:003 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any
        more to use this proverb in Israel.

018:004 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also
        the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall
        die.

018:005 But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,

018:006 And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up
        his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath
        defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a
        menstruous woman,

018:007 And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor
        his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his
        bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a
        garment;

018:008 He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken
        any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath
        executed true judgment between man and man,

018:009 Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to
        deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord
        GOD.

018:010 If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and
        that doeth the like to any one of these things,

018:011 And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten
        upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,

018:012 Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence,
        hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to
        the idols, hath committed abomination,

018:013 Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he
        then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these
        abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon
        him.

018:014 Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins
        which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,

018:015 That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up
        his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled
        his neighbour's wife,

018:016 Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge,
        neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to
        the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,

018:017 That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not
        received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath
        walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of
        his father, he shall surely live.

018:018 As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his
        brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his
        people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.

018:019 Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the
        father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right,
        and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall
        surely live.

018:020 The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear
        the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the
        iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall
        be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon
        him.

018:021 But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath
        committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is
        lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.

018:022 All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not
        be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done
        he shall live.

018:023 Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith
        the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and
        live?

018:024 But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness,
        and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the
        abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his
        righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his
        trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath
        sinned, in them shall he die.

018:025 Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O
        house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways
        unequal?

018:026 When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and
        committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that
        he hath done shall he die.

018:027 Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness
        that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and
        right, he shall save his soul alive.

018:028 Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his
        transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live,
        he shall not die.

018:029 Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not
        equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your
        ways unequal?

018:030 Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one
        according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn
        yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not
        be your ruin.

018:031 Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
        transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for
        why will ye die, O house of Israel?

018:032 For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith
        the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.

019:001 Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,

019:002 And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among
        lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.

019:003 And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion,
        and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.

019:004 The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and
        they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.

019:005 Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost,
        then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young
        lion.

019:006 And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young
        lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.

019:007 And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their
        cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by
        the noise of his roaring.

019:008 Then the nations set against him on every side from the
        provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in
        their pit.

019:009 And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the
        king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice
        should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.

019:010 Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters:
        she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many
        waters.

019:011 And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare
        rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches,
        and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her
        branches.

019:012 But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the
        ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods
        were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.

019:013 And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty
        ground.

019:014 And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath
        devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a
        sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a
        lamentation.

020:001 And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month,
        the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of
        Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.

020:002 Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,

020:003 Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto
        them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me?
        As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by
        you.

020:004 Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause
        them to know the abominations of their fathers:

020:005 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I
        chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the
        house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of
        Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the
        LORD your God;

020:006 In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them
        forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for
        them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all
        lands:

020:007 Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations
        of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of
        Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

020:008 But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me:
        they did not every man cast away the abominations of their
        eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I
        said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my
        anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

020:009 But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be
        polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose
        sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth
        out of the land of Egypt.

020:010 Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,
        and brought them into the wilderness.

020:011 And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments,
        which if a man do, he shall even live in them.

020:012 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me
        and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that
        sanctify them.

020:013 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness:
        they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my
        judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and
        my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour
        out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.

020:014 But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be
        polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them
        out.

020:015 Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that
        I would not bring them into the land which I had given them,
        flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;

020:016 Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my
        statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after
        their idols.

020:017 Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them,
        neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.

020:018 But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not
        in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their
        judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:

020:019 I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my
        judgments, and do them;

020:020 And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me
        and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.

020:021 Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked
        not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them,
        which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted
        my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them,
        to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.

020:022 Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's
        sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the
        heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.

020:023 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I
        would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them
        through the countries;

020:024 Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised
        my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were
        after their fathers' idols.

020:025 Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and
        judgments whereby they should not live;

020:026 And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to
        pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might
        make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am
        the LORD.

020:027 Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say
        unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers
        have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass
        against me.

020:028 For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I
        lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every
        high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there
        their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of
        their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and
        poured out there their drink offerings.

020:029 Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go?
        And the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day.

020:030 Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
        GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and
        commit ye whoredom after their abominations?

020:031 For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass
        through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols,
        even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house
        of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be
        enquired of by you.

020:032 And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that
        ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the
        countries, to serve wood and stone.

020:033 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and
        with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I
        rule over you:

020:034 And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you
        out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty
        hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.

020:035 And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and
        there will I plead with you face to face.

020:036 Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the
        land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.

020:037 And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring
        you into the bond of the covenant:

020:038 And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that
        transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the
        country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the
        land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

020:039 As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye,
        serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will
        not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with
        your gifts, and with your idols.

020:040 For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of
        Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of
        Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept
        them, and there will I require your offerings, and the
        firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.

020:041 I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out
        from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein
        ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before
        the heathen.

020:042 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you
        into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I
        lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.

020:043 And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings,
        wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in
        your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.

020:044 And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with
        you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor
        according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith
        the Lord GOD.

020:045 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

020:046 Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word
        toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south
        field;

020:047 And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD;
        Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee,
        and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry
        tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces
        from the south to the north shall be burned therein.

020:048 And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it
        shall not be quenched.

020:049 Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak
        parables?

021:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

021:002 Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word
        toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of
        Israel,

021:003 And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I
        am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his
        sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the
        wicked.

021:004 Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and
        the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his
        sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:

021:005 That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my
        sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.

021:006 Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy
        loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.

021:007 And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest
        thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it
        cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be
        feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be
        weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to
        pass, saith the Lord GOD.

021:008 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

021:009 Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A
        sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:

021:010 It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that
        it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the
        rod of my son, as every tree.

021:011 And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled:
        this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into
        the hand of the slayer.

021:012 Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it
        shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of
        the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy
        thigh.

021:013 Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the
        rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.

021:014 Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands
        together. and let the sword be doubled the third time, the
        sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are
        slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.

021:015 I have set the point of the sword against all their gates,
        that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah!
        it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.

021:016 Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the
        left, whithersoever thy face is set.

021:017 I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my
        fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.

021:018 The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,

021:019 Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword
        of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth
        out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the
        head of the way to the city.

021:020 Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the
        Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.

021:021 For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at
        the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his
        arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the
        liver.

021:022 At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint
        captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the
        voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the
        gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.

021:023 And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their
        sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to
        remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.

021:024 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your
        iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are
        discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear;
        because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be
        taken with the hand.

021:025 And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come,
        when iniquity shall have an end,

021:026 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the
        crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and
        abase him that is high.

021:027 I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no
        more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.

021:028 And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord
        GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach;
        even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the
        slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the
        glittering:

021:029 Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie
        unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are
        slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity
        shall have an end.

021:030 Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee
        in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy
        nativity.

021:031 And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow
        against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into
        the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.

021:032 Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the
        midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the
        LORD have spoken it.

022:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

022:002 Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the
        bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.

022:003 Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth
        blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh
        idols against herself to defile herself.

022:004 Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and
        hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and
        thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto
        thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the
        heathen, and a mocking to all countries.

022:005 Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall
        mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.

022:006 Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their
        power to shed blood.

022:007 In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst
        of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in
        thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.

022:008 Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my
        sabbaths.

022:009 In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee
        they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit
        lewdness.

022:010 In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee
        have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.

022:011 And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife;
        and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and
        another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's
        daughter.

022:012 In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken
        usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy
        neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord
        GOD.

022:013 Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest
        gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in
        the midst of thee.

022:014 Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the
        days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it,
        and will do it.

022:015 And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee
        in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.

022:016 And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight
        of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

022:017 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

022:018 Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all
        they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of
        the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.

022:019 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become
        dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of
        Jerusalem.

022:020 As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,
        into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to
        melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury,
        and I will leave you there, and melt you.

022:021 Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my
        wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.

022:022 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye
        be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the
        LORD have poured out my fury upon you.

022:023 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

022:024 Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not
        cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.

022:025 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof,
        like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured
        souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they
        have made her many widows in the midst thereof.

022:026 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy
        things: they have put no difference between the holy and
        profane, neither have they shewed difference between the
        unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my
        sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

022:027 Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the
        prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest
        gain.

022:028 And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter,
        seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith
        the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.

022:029 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised
        robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have
        oppressed the stranger wrongfully.

022:030 And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the
        hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I
        should not destroy it: but I found none.

022:031 Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have
        consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I
        recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.

023:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

023:002 Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:

023:003 And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed
        whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed,
        and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.

023:004 And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her
        sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters.
        Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem
        Aholibah.

023:005 And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted
        on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,

023:006 Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them
        desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.

023:007 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that
        were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she
        doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.

023:008 Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her
        youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her
        virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.

023:009 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers,
        into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.

023:010 These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her
        daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous
        among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.

023:011 And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in
        her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than
        her sister in her whoredoms.

023:012 She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and
        rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses,
        all of them desirable young men.

023:013 Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,

023:014 And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men
        pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans
        pourtrayed with vermilion,

023:015 Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire
        upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the
        manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their
        nativity:

023:016 And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon
        them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.

023:017 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they
        defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with
        them, and her mind was alienated from them.

023:018 So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness:
        then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was
        alienated from her sister.

023:019 Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance
        the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in
        the land of Egypt.

023:020 For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the
        flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.

023:021 Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth,
        in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy
        youth.

023:022 Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
        raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is
        alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;

023:023 The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and
        Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable
        young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all
        of them riding upon horses.

023:024 And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and
        wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set
        against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I
        will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee
        according to their judgments.

023:025 And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal
        furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine
        ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take
        thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured
        by the fire.

023:026 They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away
        thy fair jewels.

023:027 Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy
        whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt
        not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.

023:028 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into
        the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from
        whom thy mind is alienated:

023:029 And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away
        all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the
        nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy
        lewdness and thy whoredoms.

023:030 I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a
        whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with
        their idols.

023:031 Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I
        give her cup into thine hand.

023:032 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup
        deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in
        derision; it containeth much.

023:033 Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup
        of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister
        Samaria.

023:034 Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break
        the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I
        have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

023:035 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten
        me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy
        lewdness and thy whoredoms.

023:036 The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge
        Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their
        abominations;

023:037 That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their
        hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and
        have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass
        for them through the fire, to devour them.

023:038 Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my
        sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.

023:039 For when they had slain their children to their idols, then
        they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and,
        lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.

023:040 And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,
        unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom
        thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst
        thyself with ornaments,

023:041 And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it,
        whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.

023:042 And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and
        with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the
        wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and
        beautiful crowns upon their heads.

023:043 Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now
        commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?

023:044 Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that
        playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto
        Aholibah, the lewd women.

023:045 And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner
        of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed
        blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their
        hands.

023:046 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon
        them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.

023:047 And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch
        them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their
        daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.

023:048 Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all
        women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.

023:049 And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall
        bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the
        Lord GOD.

024:001 Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day
        of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

024:002 Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same
        day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this
        same day.

024:003 And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto
        them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and
        also pour water into it:

024:004 Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the
        thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.

024:005 Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under
        it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it
        therein.

024:006 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to
        the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out
        of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.

024:007 For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top
        of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with
        dust;

024:008 That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have
        set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be
        covered.

024:009 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I
        will even make the pile for fire great.

024:010 Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it
        well, and let the bones be burned.

024:011 Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it
        may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be
        molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.

024:012 She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went
        not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.

024:013 In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and
        thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy
        filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon
        thee.

024:014 I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will
        do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will
        I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings,
        shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.

024:015 Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

024:016 Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine
        eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep,
        neither shall thy tears run down.

024:017 Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire
        of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet,
        and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.

024:018 So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife
        died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.

024:019 And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these
        things are to us, that thou doest so?

024:020 Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me,
        saying,

024:021 Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
        Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your
        strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul
        pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left
        shall fall by the sword.

024:022 And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips,
        nor eat the bread of men.

024:023 And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon
        your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away
        for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.

024:024 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath
        done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I
        am the Lord GOD.

024:025 Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take
        from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire
        of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their
        sons and their daughters,

024:026 That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to
        cause thee to hear it with thine ears?

024:027 In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped,
        and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a
        sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

025:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

025:002 Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy
        against them;

025:003 And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD;
        Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my
        sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of
        Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah,
        when they went into captivity;

025:004 Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east
        for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee,
        and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit,
        and they shall drink thy milk.

025:005 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites
        a couching place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the
        LORD.

025:006 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine
        hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with
        all thy despite against the land of Israel;

025:007 Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and
        will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut
        thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out
        of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know
        that I am the LORD.

025:008 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say,
        Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen;

025:009 Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the
        cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory
        of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,

025:010 Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give
        them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered
        among the nations.

025:011 And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know
        that I am the LORD.

025:012 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against
        the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly
        offended, and revenged himself upon them;

025:013 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out
        mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it;
        and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan
        shall fall by the sword.

025:014 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people
        Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and
        according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith
        the Lord GOD.

025:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by
        revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to
        destroy it for the old hatred;

025:016 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out
        mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the
        Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

025:017 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious
        rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall
        lay my vengeance upon them.

026:001 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of
        the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

026:002 Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem,
        Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is
        turned unto me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:

026:003 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee,
        O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee,
        as the sea causeth his waves to come up.

026:004 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her
        towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her
        like the top of a rock.

026:005 It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of
        the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it
        shall become a spoil to the nations.

026:006 And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the
        sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

026:007 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus
        Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the
        north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and
        companies, and much people.

026:008 He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and
        he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against
        thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.

026:009 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with
        his axes he shall break down thy towers.

026:010 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall
        cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the
        horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he
        shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein
        is made a breach.

026:011 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy
        streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong
        garrisons shall go down to the ground.

026:012 And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of
        thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and
        destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and
        thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.

026:013 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the
        sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.

026:014 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a
        place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I
        the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

026:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at
        the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the
        slaughter is made in the midst of thee?

026:016 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their
        thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered
        garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they
        shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment,
        and be astonished at thee.

026:017 And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to
        thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring
        men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and
        her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that
        haunt it!

026:018 Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the
        isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.

026:019 For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate
        city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall
        bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover
        thee;

026:020 When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the
        pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the
        low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them
        that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I
        shall set glory in the land of the living;

026:021 I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though
        thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith
        the Lord GOD.

027:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

027:002 Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;

027:003 And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of
        the sea, which art a merchant of the people for many isles,
        Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of
        perfect beauty.

027:004 Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have
        perfected thy beauty.

027:005 They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they
        have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.

027:006 Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company
        of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out
        of the isles of Chittim.

027:007 Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou
        spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles
        of Elishah was that which covered thee.

027:008 The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise
        men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots.

027:009 The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee
        thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were
        in thee to occupy thy merchandise.

027:010 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy
        men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they
        set forth thy comeliness.

027:011 The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round
        about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their
        shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty
        perfect.

027:012 Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all
        kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded
        in thy fairs.

027:013 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they
        traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.

027:014 They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses
        and horsemen and mules.

027:015 The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the
        merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee for a present
        horns of ivory and ebony.

027:016 Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares
        of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds,
        purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and
        agate.

027:017 Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they
        traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey,
        and oil, and balm.

027:018 Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy
        making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of
        Helbon, and white wool.

027:019 Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs:
        bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.

027:020 Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.

027:021 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee
        in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy
        merchants.

027:022 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants:
        they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with
        all precious stones, and gold.

027:023 Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur,
        and Chilmad, were thy merchants.

027:024 These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue
        clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel,
        bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.

027:025 The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou
        wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the
        seas.

027:026 Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind
        hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.

027:027 Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and
        thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise,
        and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy
        company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the
        midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.

027:028 The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.

027:029 And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots
        of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand
        upon the land;

027:030 And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and
        shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads,
        they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:

027:031 And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird
        them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with
        bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.

027:032 And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for
        thee, and lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus,
        like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?

027:033 When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many
        people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the
        multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.

027:034 In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the
        depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in
        the midst of thee shall fall.

027:035 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee,
        and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled
        in their countenance.

027:036 The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt
        be a terror, and never shalt be any more.

028:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

028:002 Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord
        GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I
        am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas;
        yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart
        as the heart of God:

028:003 Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that
        they can hide from thee:

028:004 With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten
        thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy
        treasures:

028:005 By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased
        thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy
        riches:

028:006 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine
        heart as the heart of God;

028:007 Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the
        terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords
        against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy
        brightness.

028:008 They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the
        deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.

028:009 Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but
        thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that
        slayeth thee.

028:010 Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of
        strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.

028:011 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

028:012 Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and
        say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the
        sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

028:013 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone
        was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the
        beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald,
        and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets
        and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou
        wast created.

028:014 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set
        thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast
        walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

028:015 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
        created, till iniquity was found in thee.

028:016 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst
        of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will
        cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will
        destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones
        of fire.

028:017 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast
        corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast
        thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they
        may behold thee.

028:018 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
        iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I
        bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour
        thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the
        sight of all them that behold thee.

028:019 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished
        at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any
        more.

028:020 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

028:021 Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against
        it,

028:022 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O
        Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they
        shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed
        judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.

028:023 For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her
        streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her
        by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that
        I am the LORD.

028:024 And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of
        Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about
        them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the
        Lord GOD.

028:025 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house
        of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and
        shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then
        shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant
        Jacob.

028:026 And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses,
        and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence,
        when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise
        them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD
        their God.

029:001 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of
        the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

029:002 Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
        prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:

029:003 Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against
        thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in
        the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine
        own, and I have made it for myself.

029:004 But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of
        thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up
        out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers
        shall stick unto thy scales.

029:005 And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all
        the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields;
        thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given
        thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of
        the heaven.

029:006 And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the
        LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of
        Israel.

029:007 When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and
        rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou
        brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.

029:008 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a
        sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.

029:009 And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they
        shall know that I am the LORD: because he hath said, The river
        is mine, and I have made it.

029:010 Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers,
        and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate,
        from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.

029:011 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall
        pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.

029:012 And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the
        countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities
        that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will
        scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse
        them through the countries.

029:013 Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I
        gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were
        scattered:

029:014 And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause
        them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of
        their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.

029:015 It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt
        itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them,
        that they shall no more rule over the nations.

029:016 And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel,
        which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall
        look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

029:017 And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the
        first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the
        LORD came unto me, saying,

029:018 Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to
        serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald,
        and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his
        army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against
        it:

029:019 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the
        land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he
        shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her
        prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.

029:020 I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he
        served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord
        GOD.

029:021 In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to
        bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in
        the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

030:001 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

030:002 Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl
        ye, Woe worth the day!

030:003 For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a
        cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.

030:004 And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be
        in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they
        shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be
        broken down.

030:005 Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people,
        and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall
        fall with them by the sword.

030:006 Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall;
        and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of
        Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.

030:007 And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that
        are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the
        cities that are wasted.

030:008 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire
        in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.

030:009 In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make
        the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon
        them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.

030:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of
        Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.

030:011 He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall
        be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their
        swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.

030:012 And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the
        hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all
        that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have
        spoken it.

030:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I
        will cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall
        be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a
        fear in the land of Egypt.

030:014 And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan,
        and will execute judgments in No.

030:015 And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I
        will cut off the multitude of No.

030:016 And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and
        No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses
        daily.

030:017 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword:
        and these cities shall go into captivity.

030:018 At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall
        break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength
        shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and
        her daughters shall go into captivity.

030:019 Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know
        that I am the LORD.

030:020 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month,
        in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD
        came unto me, saying,

030:021 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt;
        and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a
        roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.

030:022 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against
        Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong,
        and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall
        out of his hand.

030:023 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will
        disperse them through the countries.

030:024 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put
        my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he
        shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded
        man.

030:025 But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the
        arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am
        the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king
        of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of
        Egypt.

030:026 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and
        disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I
        am the LORD.

031:001 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month,
        in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came
        unto me, saying,

031:002 Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his
        multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?

031:003 Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair
        branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature;
        and his top was among the thick boughs.

031:004 The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with
        her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little
        rivers unto all the trees of the field.

031:005 Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the
        field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became
        long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.

031:006 All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and
        under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth
        their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.

031:007 Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his
        branches: for his root was by great waters.

031:008 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir
        trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were
        not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was
        like unto him in his beauty.

031:009 I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that
        all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied
        him.

031:010 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up
        thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick
        boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;

031:011 I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one
        of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven
        him out for his wickedness.

031:012 And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,
        and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys
        his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the
        rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone
        down from his shadow, and have left him.

031:013 Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and
        all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:

031:014 To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt
        themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among
        the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their
        height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto
        death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the
        children of men, with them that go down to the pit.

031:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the
        grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I
        restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were
        stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the
        trees of the field fainted for him.

031:016 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I
        cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and
        all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all
        that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of
        the earth.

031:017 They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain
        with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under
        his shadow in the midst of the heathen.

031:018 To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the
        trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees
        of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in
        the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the
        sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord
        GOD.

032:001 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month,
        in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came
        unto me, saying,

032:002 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt,
        and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations,
        and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth
        with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and
        fouledst their rivers.

032:003 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net
        over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring
        thee up in my net.

032:004 Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth
        upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the
        heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the
        whole earth with thee.

032:005 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the
        valleys with thy height.

032:006 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou
        swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full
        of thee.

032:007 And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and
        make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a
        cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.

032:008 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee,
        and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.

032:009 I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring
        thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which
        thou hast not known.

032:010 Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings
        shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my
        sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment,
        every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.

032:011 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon
        shall come upon thee.

032:012 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to
        fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall
        spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall
        be destroyed.

032:013 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the
        great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any
        more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.

032:014 Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to
        run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.

032:015 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country
        shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall
        smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I
        am the LORD.

032:016 This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the
        daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament
        for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the
        Lord GOD.

032:017 It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day
        of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

032:018 Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them
        down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto
        the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the
        pit.

032:019 Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with
        the uncircumcised.

032:020 They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the
        sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her
        multitudes.

032:021 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the
        midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down,
        they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.

032:022 Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him:
        all of them slain, fallen by the sword:

032:023 Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company
        is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the
        sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.

032:024 There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all
        of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down
        uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused
        their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne
        their shame with them that go down to the pit.

032:025 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her
        multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them
        uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was
        caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their
        shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the
        midst of them that be slain.

032:026 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are
        round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the
        sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the
        living.

032:027 And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the
        uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons
        of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but
        their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were
        the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.

032:028 Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised,
        and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword.

032:029 There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with
        their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword:
        they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go
        down to the pit.

032:030 There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the
        Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their
        terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie
        uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear
        their shame with them that go down to the pit.

032:031 Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his
        multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword,
        saith the Lord GOD.

032:032 For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he
        shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that
        are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude,
        saith the Lord GOD.

033:001 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

033:002 Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto
        them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the
        land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their
        watchman:

033:003 If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the
        trumpet, and warn the people;

033:004 Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh
        not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood
        shall be upon his own head.

033:005 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his
        blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall
        deliver his soul.

033:006 But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the
        trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and
        take any person from among them, he is taken away in his
        iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.

033:007 So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the
        house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my
        mouth, and warn them from me.

033:008 When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely
        die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way,
        that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will
        I require at thine hand.

033:009 Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from
        it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his
        iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.

033:010 Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel;
        Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be
        upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?

033:011 Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no
        pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn
        from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways;
        for why will ye die, O house of Israel?

033:012 Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy
        people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver
        him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of
        the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he
        turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be
        able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.

033:013 When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live;
        if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all
        his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his
        iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.

033:014 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if
        he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;

033:015 If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had
        robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing
        iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.

033:016 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned
        unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he
        shall surely live.

033:017 Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not
        equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.

033:018 When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and
        committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.

033:019 But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which
        is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.

033:020 Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of
        Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.

033:021 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in
        the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that
        had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is
        smitten.

033:022 Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he
        that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came
        to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no
        more dumb.

033:023 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

033:024 Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of
        Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the
        land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.

033:025 Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with
        the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed
        blood: and shall ye possess the land?

033:026 Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile
        every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?

033:027 Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live,
        surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword,
        and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to
        be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves
        shall die of the pestilence.

033:028 For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her
        strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be
        desolate, that none shall pass through.

033:029 Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the
        land most desolate because of all their abominations which
        they have committed.

033:030 Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are
        talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the
        houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother,
        saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that
        cometh forth from the LORD.

033:031 And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit
        before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they
        will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love,
        but their heart goeth after their covetousness.

033:032 And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that
        hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for
        they hear thy words, but they do them not.

033:033 And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall
        they know that a prophet hath been among them.

034:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

034:002 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel,
        prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the
        shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed
        themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?

034:003 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them
        that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.

034:004 The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed
        that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was
        broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven
        away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with
        force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.

034:005 And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and
        they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they
        were scattered.

034:006 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every
        high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of
        the earth, and none did search or seek after them.

034:007 Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

034:008 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became
        a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field,
        because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search
        for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my
        flock;

034:009 Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;

034:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds;
        and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to
        cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed
        themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their
        mouth, that they may not be meat for them.

034:011 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both
        search my sheep, and seek them out.

034:012 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is
        among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my
        sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have
        been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.

034:013 And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them
        from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and
        feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in
        all the inhabited places of the country.

034:014 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high
        mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie
        in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the
        mountains of Israel.

034:015 I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith
        the Lord GOD.

034:016 I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which
        was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and
        will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the
        fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.

034:017 And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I
        judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he
        goats.

034:018 Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good
        pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of
        your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye
        must foul the residue with your feet?

034:019 And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with
        your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your
        feet.

034:020 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even
        I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean
        cattle.

034:021 Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed
        all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them
        abroad;

034:022 Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a
        prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.

034:023 And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed
        them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall
        be their shepherd.

034:024 And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a
        prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.

034:025 And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause
        the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell
        safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.

034:026 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a
        blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his
        season; there shall be showers of blessing.

034:027 And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth
        shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their
        land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken
        the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of
        those that served themselves of them.

034:028 And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall
        the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell
        safely, and none shall make them afraid.

034:029 And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall
        be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the
        shame of the heathen any more.

034:030 Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them,
        and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith
        the Lord GOD.

034:031 And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am
        your God, saith the Lord GOD.

035:001 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

035:002 Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy
        against it,

035:003 And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount
        Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand
        against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.

035:004 I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and
        thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

035:005 Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the
        blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in
        the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity
        had an end:

035:006 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee
        unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not
        hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.

035:007 Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it
        him that passeth out and him that returneth.

035:008 And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy
        hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they
        fall that are slain with the sword.

035:009 I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall
        not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

035:010 Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two
        countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the
        LORD was there:

035:011 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do
        according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which
        thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make
        myself known among them, when I have judged thee.

035:012 And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard
        all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the
        mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are
        given us to consume.

035:013 Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have
        multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.

035:014 Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I
        will make thee desolate.

035:015 As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of
        Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou
        shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of
        it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

036:001 Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel,
        and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD:

036:002 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against
        you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:

036:003 Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because
        they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every
        side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the
        heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are
        an infamy of the people:

036:004 Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord
        GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the
        hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate
        wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a
        prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round
        about;

036:005 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my
        jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and
        against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their
        possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful
        minds, to cast it out for a prey.

036:006 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto
        the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the
        valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my
        jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of
        the heathen:

036:007 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand,
        Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their
        shame.

036:008 But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your
        branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for
        they are at hand to come.

036:009 For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye
        shall be tilled and sown:

036:010 And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel,
        even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the
        wastes shall be builded:

036:011 And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall
        increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old
        estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings:
        and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

036:012 Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel;
        and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their
        inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of
        men.

036:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land
        devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations:

036:014 Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy
        nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.

036:015 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
        heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the
        people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall
        any more, saith the Lord GOD.

036:016 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

036:017 Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land,
        they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their
        way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.

036:018 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they
        had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had
        polluted it:

036:019 And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were
        dispersed through the countries: according to their way and
        according to their doings I judged them.

036:020 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went,
        they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are
        the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.

036:021 But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel
        had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.

036:022 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord
        GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for
        mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the
        heathen, whither ye went.

036:023 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among
        the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and
        the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD,
        when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.

036:024 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out
        of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.

036:025 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
        clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will
        I cleanse you.

036:026 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
        within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your
        flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.

036:027 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in
        my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.

036:028 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers;
        and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

036:029 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will
        call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine
        upon you.

036:030 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of
        the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine
        among the heathen.

036:031 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings
        that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own
        sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.

036:032 Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known
        unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house
        of Israel.

036:033 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed
        you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in
        the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.

036:034 And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate
        in the sight of all that passed by.

036:035 And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like
        the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined
        cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.

036:036 Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that
        I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was
        desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.

036:037 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by
        the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them
        with men like a flock.

036:038 As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn
        feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of
        men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

037:001 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the
        spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley
        which was full of bones,

037:002 And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there
        were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very
        dry.

037:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I
        answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.

037:004 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto
        them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.

037:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause
        breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:

037:006 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon
        you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye
        shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

037:007 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there
        was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came
        together, bone to his bone.

037:008 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon
        them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath
        in them.

037:009 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of
        man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from
        the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that
        they may live.

037:010 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into
        them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an
        exceeding great army.

037:011 Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
        house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and
        our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.

037:012 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
        Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to
        come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of
        Israel.

037:013 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your
        graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,

037:014 And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall
        place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD
        have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.

037:015 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

037:016 Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon
        it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions:
        then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the
        stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his
        companions:

037:017 And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall
        become one in thine hand.

037:018 And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,
        saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?

037:019 Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take
        the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the
        tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even
        with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they
        shall be one in mine hand.

037:020 And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand
        before their eyes.

037:021 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
        take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither
        they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring
        them into their own land:

037:022 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains
        of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they
        shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided
        into two kingdoms any more at all.

037:023 Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their
        idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their
        transgressions: but I will save them out of all their
        dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse
        them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.

037:024 And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all
        shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments,
        and observe my statutes, and do them.

037:025 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob
        my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall
        dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their
        children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be
        their prince for ever.

037:026 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall
        be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them,
        and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of
        them for evermore.

037:027 My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their
        God, and they shall be my people.

037:028 And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel,
        when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

038:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

038:002 Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the
        chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,

038:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O
        Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

038:004 And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I
        will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and
        horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a
        great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling
        swords:

038:005 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield
        and helmet:

038:006 Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north
        quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.

038:007 Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy
        company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto
        them.

038:008 After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years
        thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the
        sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the
        mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is
        brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely
        all of them.

038:009 Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a
        cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many
        people with thee.

038:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at
        the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt
        think an evil thought:

038:011 And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled
        villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell
        safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither
        bars nor gates,

038:012 To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon
        the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the
        people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten
        cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.

038:013 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the
        young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to
        take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey?
        to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods,
        to take a great spoil?

038:014 Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith
        the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth
        safely, shalt thou not know it?

038:015 And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts,
        thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon
        horses, a great company, and a mighty army:

038:016 And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud
        to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will
        bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when
        I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.

038:017 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in
        old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which
        prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee
        against them?

038:018 And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come
        against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury
        shall come up in my face.

038:019 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,
        Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land
        of Israel;

038:020 So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven,
        and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that
        creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face
        of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains
        shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and
        every wall shall fall to the ground.

038:021 And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my
        mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be
        against his brother.

038:022 And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood;
        and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the
        many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great
        hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

038:023 Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be
        known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I
        am the LORD.

039:001 Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say,
        Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the
        chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

039:002 And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of
        thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and
        will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:

039:003 And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause
        thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.

039:004 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all
        thy bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee
        unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of
        the field to be devoured.

039:005 Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it,
        saith the Lord GOD.

039:006 And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell
        carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the
        LORD.

039:007 So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people
        Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more:
        and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in
        Israel.

039:008 Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this
        is the day whereof I have spoken.

039:009 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth,
        and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields
        and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves,
        and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven
        years:

039:010 So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut
        down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons
        with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and
        rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD.

039:011 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto
        Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the
        passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses
        of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his
        multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.

039:012 And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them,
        that they may cleanse the land.

039:013 Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall
        be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith
        the Lord GOD.

039:014 And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing
        through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain
        upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of
        seven months shall they search.

039:015 And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth
        a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the
        buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.

039:016 And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall
        they cleanse the land.

039:017 And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto
        every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field,
        Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side
        to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great
        sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh,
        and drink blood.

039:018 Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of
        the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of
        bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.

039:019 And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye
        be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.

039:020 Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,
        with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.

039:021 And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen
        shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I
        have laid upon them.

039:022 So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God
        from that day and forward.

039:023 And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into
        captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against
        me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the
        hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.

039:024 According to their uncleanness and according to their
        transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from
        them.

039:025 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the
        captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of
        Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;

039:026 After that they have borne their shame, and all their
        trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they
        dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.

039:027 When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered
        them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in
        the sight of many nations;

039:028 Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which
        caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I
        have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of
        them any more there.

039:029 Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have
        poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord
        GOD.

040:001 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the
        beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the
        fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the
        selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me
        thither.

040:002 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel,
        and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the
        frame of a city on the south.

040:003 And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose
        appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of
        flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the
        gate.

040:004 And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes,
        and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I
        shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto
        thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to
        the house of Israel.

040:005 And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and
        in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the
        cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the
        building, one reed; and the height, one reed.

040:006 Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and
        went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the
        gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the
        gate, which was one reed broad.

040:007 And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed
        broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and
        the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was
        one reed.

040:008 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.

040:009 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the
        posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was
        inward.

040:010 And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on
        this side, and three on that side; they three were of one
        measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on
        that side.

040:011 And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten
        cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

040:012 The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on
        this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the
        little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits
        on that side.

040:013 He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber
        to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty
        cubits, door against door.

040:014 He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of
        the court round about the gate.

040:015 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of
        the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.

040:016 And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to
        their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the
        arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each
        post were palm trees.

040:017 Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were
        chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about:
        thirty chambers were upon the pavement.

040:018 And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the
        length of the gates was the lower pavement.

040:019 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower
        gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred
        cubits eastward and northward.

040:020 And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the
        north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth
        thereof.

040:021 And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and
        three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches
        thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length
        thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty
        cubits.

040:022 And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees,
        were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the
        east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches
        thereof were before them.

040:023 And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate
        toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from
        gate to gate an hundred cubits.

040:024 After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate
        toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the
        arches thereof according to these measures.

040:025 And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round
        about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and
        the breadth five and twenty cubits.

040:026 And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches
        thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this
        side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.

040:027 And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and
        he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred
        cubits.

040:028 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he
        measured the south gate according to these measures;

040:029 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and
        the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there
        were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it
        was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.

040:030 And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long,
        and five cubits broad.

040:031 And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm
        trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had
        eight steps.

040:032 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he
        measured the gate according to these measures.

040:033 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and
        the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and
        there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round
        about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits
        broad.

040:034 And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm
        trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that
        side: and the going up to it had eight steps.

040:035 And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according
        to these measures;

040:036 The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches
        thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was
        fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

040:037 And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm
        trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that
        side: and the going up to it had eight steps.

040:038 And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of
        the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.

040:039 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and
        two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering
        and the sin offering and the trespass offering.

040:040 And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the
        north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was
        at the porch of the gate, were two tables.

040:041 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side,
        by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew
        their sacrifices.

040:042 And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering,
        of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad,
        and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments
        wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.

040:043 And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about:
        and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.

040:044 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in
        the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and
        their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the
        east gate having the prospect toward the north.

040:045 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward
        the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of
        the house.

040:046 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the
        priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the
        sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the
        LORD to minister unto him.

040:047 So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an
        hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was
        before the house.

040:048 And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each
        post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits
        on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on
        this side, and three cubits on that side.

040:049 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth
        eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they
        went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on
        this side, and another on that side.

041:001 Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts,
        six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the
        other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.

041:002 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of
        the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on
        the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty
        cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.

041:003 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two
        cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door,
        seven cubits.

041:004 So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the
        breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto
        me, This is the most holy place.

041:005 After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the
        breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the
        house on every side.

041:006 And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty
        in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the
        house for the side chambers round about, that they might have
        hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.

041:007 And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward
        to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went
        still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of
        the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest
        chamber to the highest by the midst.

041:008 I saw also the height of the house round about: the
        foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great
        cubits.

041:009 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber
        without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the
        place of the side chambers that were within.

041:010 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits
        round about the house on every side.

041:011 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that
        was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward
        the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five
        cubits round about.

041:012 Now the building that was before the separate place at the end
        toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the
        building was five cubits thick round about, and the length
        thereof ninety cubits.

041:013 So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the
        separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an
        hundred cubits long;

041:014 Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate
        place toward the east, an hundred cubits.

041:015 And he measured the length of the building over against the
        separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof
        on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with
        the inner temple, and the porches of the court;

041:016 The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries
        round about on their three stories, over against the door,
        cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the
        windows, and the windows were covered;

041:017 To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and
        without, and by all the wall round about within and without,
        by measure.

041:018 And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm
        tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had
        two faces;

041:019 So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one
        side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the
        other side: it was made through all the house round about.

041:020 From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm
        trees made, and on the wall of the temple.

041:021 The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the
        sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the
        other.

041:022 The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length
        thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length
        thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto
        me, This is the table that is before the LORD.

041:023 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

041:024 And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two
        leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.

041:025 And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple,
        cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls;
        and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch
        without.

041:026 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side
        and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the
        side chambers of the house, and thick planks.

042:001 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward
        the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over
        against the separate place, and which was before the building
        toward the north.

042:002 Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and
        the breadth was fifty cubits.

042:003 Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court,
        and over against the pavement which was for the utter court,
        was gallery against gallery in three stories.

042:004 And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth
        inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.

042:005 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were
        higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of
        the building.

042:006 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the
        pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened
        more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.

042:007 And the wall that was without over against the chambers,
        toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the
        length thereof was fifty cubits.

042:008 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court
        was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred
        cubits.

042:009 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side,
        as one goeth into them from the utter court.

042:010 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court
        toward the east, over against the separate place, and over
        against the building.

042:011 And the way before them was like the appearance of the
        chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as
        broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to
        their fashions, and according to their doors.

042:012 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward
        the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way
        directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into
        them.

042:013 Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south
        chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy
        chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall
        eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy
        things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the
        trespass offering; for the place is holy.

042:014 When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of
        the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay
        their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and
        shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those
        things which are for the people.

042:015 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he
        brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the
        east, and measured it round about.

042:016 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five
        hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

042:017 He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the
        measuring reed round about.

042:018 He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the
        measuring reed.

042:019 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred
        reeds with the measuring reed.

042:020 He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about,
        five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a
        separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.

043:001 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that
        looketh toward the east:

043:002 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way
        of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters:
        and the earth shined with his glory.

043:003 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I
        saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to
        destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I
        saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.

043:004 And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of
        the gate whose prospect is toward the east.

043:005 So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;
        and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.

043:006 And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man
        stood by me.

043:007 And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and
        the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the
        midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name,
        shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor
        their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their
        kings in their high places.

043:008 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and
        their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they
        have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they
        have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.

043:009 Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of
        their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of
        them for ever.

043:010 Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that
        they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure
        the pattern.

043:011 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them
        the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings
        out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms
        thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms
        thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their
        sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the
        ordinances thereof, and do them.

043:012 This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the
        whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold,
        this is the law of the house.

043:013 And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The
        cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be
        a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by
        the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall
        be the higher place of the altar.

043:014 And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle
        shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the
        lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits,
        and the breadth one cubit.

043:015 So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and
        upward shall be four horns.

043:016 And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad,
        square in the four squares thereof.

043:017 And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen
        broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it
        shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit
        about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.

043:018 And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD;
        These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they
        shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to
        sprinkle blood thereon.

043:019 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the
        seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me,
        saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.

043:020 And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the
        four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and
        upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge
        it.

043:021 Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he
        shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the
        sanctuary.

043:022 And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats
        without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the
        altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.

043:023 When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a
        young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock
        without blemish.

043:024 And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests
        shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a
        burnt offering unto the LORD.

043:025 Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin
        offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram
        out of the flock, without blemish.

043:026 Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they
        shall consecrate themselves.

043:027 And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the
        eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt
        offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will
        accept you, saith the Lord GOD.

044:001 Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward
        sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.

044:002 Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall
        not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the
        LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it
        shall be shut.

044:003 It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat
        bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch
        of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.

044:004 Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house:
        and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the
        house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.

044:005 And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold
        with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto
        thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD,
        and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the
        house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.

044:006 And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of
        Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it
        suffice you of all your abominations,

044:007 In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers,
        uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in
        my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my
        bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant
        because of all your abominations.

044:008 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye
        have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.

044:009 Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart,
        nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of
        any stranger that is among the children of Israel.

044:010 And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel
        went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols;
        they shall even bear their iniquity.

044:011 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at
        the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they
        shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the
        people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto
        them.

044:012 Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and
        caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore
        have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD,
        and they shall bear their iniquity.

044:013 And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a
        priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in
        the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and
        their abominations which they have committed.

044:014 But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for
        all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done
        therein.

044:015 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the
        charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray
        from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and
        they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the
        blood, saith the Lord GOD:

044:016 They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near
        to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my
        charge.

044:017 And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the
        gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen
        garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they
        minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.

044:018 They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have
        linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird
        themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.

044:019 And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the
        utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments
        wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers,
        and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not
        sanctify the people with their garments.

044:020 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks
        to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.

044:021 Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the
        inner court.

044:022 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that
        is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the
        house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.

044:023 And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy
        and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and
        the clean.

044:024 And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they
        shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep
        my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall
        hallow my sabbaths.

044:025 And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves:
        but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter,
        for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may
        defile themselves.

044:026 And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven
        days.

044:027 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the
        inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his
        sin offering, saith the Lord GOD.

044:028 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their
        inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I
        am their possession.

044:029 They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and
        the trespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel
        shall be theirs.

044:030 And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every
        oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the
        priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your
        dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.

044:031 The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself,
        or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.

045:001 Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for
        inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy
        portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five
        and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten
        thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round
        about.

045:002 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in
        length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and
        fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.

045:003 And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and
        twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it
        shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.

045:004 The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the
        ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister
        unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and
        an holy place for the sanctuary.

045:005 And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten
        thousand of breadth shall also the Levites, the ministers of
        the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty
        chambers.

045:006 And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand
        broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the
        oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house
        of Israel.

045:007 And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on
        the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the
        possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy
        portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west
        side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length
        shall be over against one of the portions, from the west
        border unto the east border.

045:008 In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes
        shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land
        shall they give to the house of Israel according to their
        tribes.

045:009 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of
        Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and
        justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the
        Lord GOD.

045:010 Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just
        bath.

045:011 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath
        may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the
        tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the
        homer.

045:012 And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five
        and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

045:013 This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an
        ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part
        of an ephah of an homer of barley:

045:014 Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall
        offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an
        homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer:

045:015 And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the
        fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt
        offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for
        them, saith the Lord GOD.

045:016 All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the
        prince in Israel.

045:017 And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and
        meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the
        new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the
        house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the
        meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace
        offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.

045:018 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day
        of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish,
        and cleanse the sanctuary:

045:019 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering,
        and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four
        corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the
        gate of the inner court.

045:020 And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every
        one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye
        reconcile the house.

045:021 In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye
        shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened
        bread shall be eaten.

045:022 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for
        all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.

045:023 And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering
        to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish
        daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin
        offering.

045:024 And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a
        bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an
        ephah.

045:025 In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall
        he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to
        the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and
        according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.

046:001 Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that
        looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days;
        but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the
        new moon it shall be opened.

046:002 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that
        gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the
        priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace
        offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate:
        then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until
        the evening.

046:003 Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of
        this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new
        moons.

046:004 And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the
        LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish,
        and a ram without blemish.

046:005 And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the
        meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and
        an hin of oil to an ephah.

046:006 And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock
        without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be
        without blemish.

046:007 And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock,
        and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his
        hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.

046:008 And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of
        the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way
        thereof.

046:009 But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in
        the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north
        gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and
        he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth
        by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way
        of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over
        against it.

046:010 And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go
        in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.

046:011 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering
        shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to
        the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an
        ephah.

046:012 Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering
        or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then
        open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall
        prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did
        on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his
        going forth one shall shut the gate.

046:013 Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a
        lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it
        every morning.

046:014 And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning,
        the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of
        oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering
        continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.

046:015 Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and
        the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.

046:016 Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of
        his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall
        be their possession by inheritance.

046:017 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his
        servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after
        it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be
        his sons' for them.

046:018 Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance
        by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he
        shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession:
        that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.

046:019 After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side
        of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which
        looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the
        two sides westward.

046:020 Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests
        shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where
        they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out
        into the utter court, to sanctify the people.

046:021 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me
        to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in
        every corner of the court there was a court.

046:022 In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of
        forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of
        one measure.

046:023 And there was a row of building round about in them, round
        about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the
        rows round about.

046:024 Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil,
        where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of
        the people.

047:001 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and,
        behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the
        house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward
        the east, and the waters came down from under from the right
        side of the house, at the south side of the altar.

047:002 Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and
        led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way
        that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on
        the right side.

047:003 And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth
        eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me
        through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.

047:004 Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the
        waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a
        thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the
        loins.

047:005 Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I
        could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim
        in, a river that could not be passed over.

047:006 And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he
        brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.

047:007 Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were
        very many trees on the one side and on the other.

047:008 Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east
        country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea:
        which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be
        healed.

047:009 And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which
        moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and
        there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these
        waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every
        thing shall live whither the river cometh.

047:010 And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon
        it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to
        spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their
        kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.

047:011 But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not
        be healed; they shall be given to salt.

047:012 And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on
        that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not
        fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall
        bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their
        waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof
        shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.

047:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye
        shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of
        Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.

047:014 And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning
        the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers:
        and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.

047:015 And this shall be the border of the land toward the north
        side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to
        Zedad;

047:016 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of
        Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by
        the coast of Hauran.

047:017 And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of
        Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath.
        And this is the north side.

047:018 And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from
        Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by
        Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the
        east side.

047:019 And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of
        strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the
        south side southward.

047:020 The west side also shall be the great sea from the border,
        till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.

047:021 So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes
        of Israel.

047:022 And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for
        an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn
        among you, which shall beget children among you: and they
        shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of
        Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes
        of Israel.

047:023 And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger
        sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the
        Lord GOD.

048:001 Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to
        the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath,
        Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of
        Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for
        Dan.

048:002 And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west
        side, a portion for Asher.

048:003 And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the
        west side, a portion for Naphtali.

048:004 And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the
        west side, a portion for Manasseh.

048:005 And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the
        west side, a portion for Ephraim.

048:006 And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the
        west side, a portion for Reuben.

048:007 And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west
        side, a portion for Judah.

048:008 And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west
        side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and
        twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the
        other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the
        sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.

048:009 The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD shall be of
        five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in
        breadth.

048:010 And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy
        oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length,
        and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the
        east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and
        twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall
        be in the midst thereof.

048:011 It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of
        Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when
        the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went
        astray.

048:012 And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto
        them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.

048:013 And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall
        have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in
        breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and
        the breadth ten thousand.

048:014 And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate
        the firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto the LORD.

048:015 And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over
        against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place
        for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city
        shall be in the midst thereof.

048:016 And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four
        thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand
        and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five
        hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.

048:017 And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two
        hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty,
        and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west
        two hundred and fifty.

048:018 And the residue in length over against the oblation of the
        holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand
        westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the
        holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto
        them that serve the city.

048:019 And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the
        tribes of Israel.

048:020 All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and
        twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare,
        with the possession of the city.

048:021 And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and
        on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of
        the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the
        oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the
        five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against
        the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy
        oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst
        thereof.

048:022 Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the
        possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is
        the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of
        Benjamin, shall be for the prince.

048:023 As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the
        west side, Benjamin shall have a portion.

048:024 And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the
        west side, Simeon shall have a portion.

048:025 And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west
        side, Issachar a portion.

048:026 And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the
        west side, Zebulun a portion.

048:027 And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west
        side, Gad a portion.

048:028 And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the
        border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in
        Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea.

048:029 This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes
        of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith
        the Lord GOD.

048:030 And these are the goings out of the city on the north side,
        four thousand and five hundred measures.

048:031 And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the
        tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben,
        one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.

048:032 And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three
        gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate
        of Dan.

048:033 And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures:
        and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one
        gate of Zebulun.

048:034 At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their
        three gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of
        Naphtali.

048:035 It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of
        the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.

Book 27	Daniel

001:001 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged
        it.

001:002 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with
        part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into
        the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the
        vessels into the treasure house of his god.

001:003 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs,
        that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of
        the king's seed, and of the princes;

001:004 Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and
        skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and
        understanding science, and such as had ability in them to
        stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the
        learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.

001:005 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's
        meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three
        years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the
        king.

001:006 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel,
        Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:

001:007 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave
        unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of
        Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of
        Abednego.

001:008 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile
        himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine
        which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the
        eunuchs that he might not defile himself.

001:009 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with
        the prince of the eunuchs.

001:010 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord
        the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why
        should he see your faces worse liking than the children which
        are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to
        the king.

001:011 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had
        set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,

001:012 Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them
        give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.

001:013 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
        countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the
        king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.

001:014 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten
        days.

001:015 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer
        and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the
        portion of the king's meat.

001:016 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine
        that they should drink; and gave them pulse.

001:017 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill
        in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in
        all visions and dreams.

001:018 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should
        bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in
        before Nebuchadnezzar.

001:019 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found
        none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore
        stood they before the king.

001:020 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king
        enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the
        magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.

001:021 And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.

002:001 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
        Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was
        troubled, and his sleep brake from him.

002:002 Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the
        astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew
        the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.

002:003 And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my
        spirit was troubled to know the dream.

002:004 Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live
        for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the
        interpretation.

002:005 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone
        from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the
        interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your
        houses shall be made a dunghill.

002:006 But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye
        shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour:
        therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.

002:007 They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants
        the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.

002:008 The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would
        gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.

002:009 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but
        one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt
        words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore
        tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the
        interpretation thereof.

002:010 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not
        a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter:
        therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such
        things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.

002:011 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is
        none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods,
        whose dwelling is not with flesh.

002:012 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and
        commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

002:013 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain;
        and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

002:014 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
        captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the
        wise men of Babylon:

002:015 He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the
        decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing
        known to Daniel.

002:016 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would
        give him time, and that he would shew the king the
        interpretation.

002:017 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to
        Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:

002:018 That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning
        this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish
        with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

002:019 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.
        Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

002:020 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever
        and ever: for wisdom and might are his:

002:021 And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings,
        and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and
        knowledge to them that know understanding:

002:022 He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in
        the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.

002:023 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who
        hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me
        now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto
        us the king's matter.

002:024 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had
        ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said
        thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me
        in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the
        interpretation.

002:025 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and
        said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of
        Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.

002:026 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was
        Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream
        which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?

002:027 Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The
        secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the
        astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the
        king;

002:028 But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and
        maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the
        latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy
        bed, are these;

002:029 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy
        bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth
        secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.

002:030 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any
        wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes
        that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that
        thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.

002:031 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great
        image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and
        the form thereof was terrible.

002:032 This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of
        silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,

002:033 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.

002:034 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which
        smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and
        brake them to pieces.

002:035 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the
        gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of
        the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away,
        that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the
        image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.

002:036 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof
        before the king.

002:037 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath
        given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.

002:038 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
        field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine
        hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this
        head of gold.

002:039 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee,
        and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over
        all the earth.

002:040 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as
        iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron
        that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.

002:041 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters'
        clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but
        there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as
        thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.

002:042 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of
        clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly
        broken.

002:043 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall
        mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not
        cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.

002:044 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up
        a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom
        shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in
        pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for
        ever.

002:045 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
        mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron,
        the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God
        hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter:
        and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.

002:046 Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and
        worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an
        oblation and sweet odours unto him.

002:047 The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is,
        that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a
        revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.

002:048 Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great
        gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon,
        and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.

002:049 Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach,
        Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of
        Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.

003:001 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height
        was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he
        set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.

003:002 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the
        princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the
        treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
        of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which
        Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

003:003 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the
        treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
        of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication
        of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they
        stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

003:004 Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,
        nations, and languages,

003:005 That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute,
        harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye
        fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
        king hath set up:

003:006 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour
        be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

003:007 Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of
        the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of
        musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell
        down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
        king had set up.

003:008 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and
        accused the Jews.

003:009 They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live
        for ever.

003:010 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall
        hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
        and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and
        worship the golden image:

003:011 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be
        cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

003:012 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of
        the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego;
        these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy
        gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

003:013 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring
        Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men
        before the king.

003:014 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O
        Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor
        worship the golden image which I have set up?

003:015 Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the
        cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all
        kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I
        have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the
        same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who
        is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?

003:016 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the
        king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in
        this matter.

003:017 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from
        the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine
        hand, O king.

003:018 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not
        serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast
        set up.

003:019 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his
        visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego:
        therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the
        furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.

003:020 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to
        bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into
        the burning fiery furnace.

003:021 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and
        their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the
        midst of the burning fiery furnace.

003:022 Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the
        furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men
        that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

003:023 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell
        down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

003:024 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in
        haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we
        cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered
        and said unto the king, True, O king.

003:025 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the
        midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the
        fourth is like the Son of God.

003:026 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning
        fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and
        Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and
        come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth
        of the midst of the fire.

003:027 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's
        counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon
        whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their
        head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell
        of fire had passed on them.

003:028 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of
        Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and
        delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed
        the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not
        serve nor worship any god, except their own God.

003:029 Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and
        language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of
        Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and
        their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no
        other God that can deliver after this sort.

003:030 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the
        province of Babylon.

004:001 Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and
        languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied
        unto you.

004:002 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high
        God hath wrought toward me.

004:003 How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his
        kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from
        generation to generation.

004:004 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in
        my palace:

004:005 I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my
        bed and the visions of my head troubled me.

004:006 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of
        Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the
        interpretation of the dream.

004:007 Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
        and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but
        they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.

004:008 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was
        Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is
        the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream,
        saying,

004:009 O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that
        the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret
        troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have
        seen, and the interpretation thereof.

004:010 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and
        behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height
        thereof was great.

004:011 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached
        unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the
        earth:

004:012 The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and
        in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow
        under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs
        thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.

004:013 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a
        watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;

004:014 He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off
        his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let
        the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his
        branches:

004:015 Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even
        with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the
        field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his
        portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:

004:016 Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart
        be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.

004:017 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand
        by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living
        may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and
        giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the
        basest of men.

004:018 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O
        Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as
        all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto
        me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of
        the holy gods is in thee.

004:019 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one
        hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said,
        Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation
        thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My
        lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the
        interpretation thereof to thine enemies.

004:020 The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose
        height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all
        the earth;

004:021 Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it
        was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt,
        and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their
        habitation:

004:022 It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy
        greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion
        to the end of the earth.

004:023 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down
        from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it;
        yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even
        with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the
        field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his
        portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass
        over him;

004:024 This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of
        the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:

004:025 That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be
        with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat
        grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven,
        and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the
        most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
        whomsoever he will.

004:026 And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree
        roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou
        shalt have known that the heavens do rule.

004:027 Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and
        break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by
        shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy
        tranquillity.

004:028 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.

004:029 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
        kingdom of Babylon.

004:030 The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I
        have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my
        power, and for the honour of my majesty?

004:031 While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice
        from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is
        spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.

004:032 And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be
        with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat
        grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until
        thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and
        giveth it to whomsoever he will.

004:033 The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and
        he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his
        body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown
        like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.

004:034 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine
        eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and
        I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that
        liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion,
        and his kingdom is from generation to generation:

004:035 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing:
        and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and
        among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his
        hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?

004:036 At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory
        of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me;
        and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was
        established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added
        unto me.

004:037 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of
        heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and
        those that walk in pride he is able to abase.

005:001 Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his
        lords, and drank wine before the thousand.

005:002 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the
        golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had
        taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king,
        and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink
        therein.

005:003 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of
        the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the
        king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in
        them.

005:004 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver,
        of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

005:005 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote
        over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of
        the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that
        wrote.

005:006 Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts
        troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and
        his knees smote one against another.

005:007 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the
        Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said
        to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing,
        and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with
        scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be
        the third ruler in the kingdom.

005:008 Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read
        the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation
        thereof.

005:009 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance
        was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.

005:010 Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords
        came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O
        king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor
        let thy countenance be changed:

005:011 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the
        holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and
        understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was
        found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the
        king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians,
        astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;

005:012 Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and
        understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard
        sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same
        Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be
        called, and he will shew the interpretation.

005:013 Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake
        and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the
        children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father
        brought out of Jewry?

005:014 I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in
        thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is
        found in thee.

005:015 And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in
        before me, that they should read this writing, and make known
        unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew
        the interpretation of the thing:

005:016 And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make
        interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read
        the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof,
        thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold
        about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.

005:017 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts
        be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will
        read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the
        interpretation.

005:018 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father
        a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:

005:019 And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and
        languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he
        slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he
        set up; and whom he would he put down.

005:020 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in
        pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took
        his glory from him:

005:021 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made
        like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses:
        they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with
        the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled
        in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it
        whomsoever he will.

005:022 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
        though thou knewest all this;

005:023 But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and
        they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and
        thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk
        wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and
        gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor
        hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and
        whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:

005:024 Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing
        was written.

005:025 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
        UPHARSIN.

005:026 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath
        numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.

005:027 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found
        wanting.

005:028 PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
        Persians.

005:029 Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with
        scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a
        proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler
        in the kingdom.

005:030 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.

005:031 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore
        and two years old.

006:001 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and
        twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;

006:002 And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first:
        that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king
        should have no damage.

006:003 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and
        princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king
        thought to set him over the whole realm.

006:004 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion
        against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find
        none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither
        was there any error or fault found in him.

006:005 Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against
        this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law
        of his God.

006:006 Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the
        king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.

006:007 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the
        princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted
        together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm
        decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man
        for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into
        the den of lions.

006:008 Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that
        it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and
        Persians, which altereth not.

006:009 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.

006:010 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into
        his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward
        Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and
        prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.

006:011 Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
        supplication before his God.

006:012 Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the
        king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man
        that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty
        days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of
        lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true,
        according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth
        not.

006:013 Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel,
        which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth
        not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but
        maketh his petition three times a day.

006:014 Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased
        with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and
        he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.

006:015 Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the
        king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is,
        That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be
        changed.

006:016 Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him
        into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto
        Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver
        thee.

006:017 And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den;
        and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the
        signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed
        concerning Daniel.

006:018 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night
        fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before
        him: and his sleep went from him.

006:019 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in
        haste unto the den of lions.

006:020 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice
        unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel,
        servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest
        continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?

006:021 Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.

006:022 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths,
        that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency
        was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no
        hurt.

006:023 Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that
        they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken
        up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him,
        because he believed in his God.

006:024 And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had
        accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions,
        them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the
        mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever
        they came at the bottom of the den.

006:025 Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and
        languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied
        unto you.

006:026 I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men
        tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the
        living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which
        shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto
        the end.

006:027 He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders
        in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the
        power of the lions.

006:028 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the
        reign of Cyrus the Persian.

007:001 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a
        dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the
        dream, and told the sum of the matters.

007:002 Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and,
        behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great
        sea.

007:003 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
        another.

007:004 The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld
        till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from
        the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's
        heart was given to it.

007:005 And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it
        raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the
        mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto
        it, Arise, devour much flesh.

007:006 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had
        upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also
        four heads; and dominion was given to it.

007:007 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth
        beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it
        had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and
        stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse
        from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.

007:008 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
        another little horn, before whom there were three of the first
        horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were
        eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.

007:009 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of
        days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of
        his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery
        flame, and his wheels as burning fire.

007:010 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
        thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten
        thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books
        were opened.

007:011 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which
        the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and
        his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.

007:012 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
        taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and
        time.

007:013 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of
        man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of
        days, and they brought him near before him.

007:014 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
        that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his
        dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass
        away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.

007:015 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and
        the visions of my head troubled me.

007:016 I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the
        truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the
        interpretation of the things.

007:017 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which
        shall arise out of the earth.

007:018 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and
        possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.

007:019 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was
        diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth
        were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in
        pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;

007:020 And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other
        which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn
        that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose
        look was more stout than his fellows.

007:021 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
        prevailed against them;

007:022 Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the
        saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints
        possessed the kingdom.

007:023 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom
        upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and
        shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and
        break it in pieces.

007:024 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall
        arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be
        diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.

007:025 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and
        shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to
        change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand
        until a time and times and the dividing of time.

007:026 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his
        dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.

007:027 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom
        under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the
        saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting
        kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.

007:028 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my
        cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in
        me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

008:001 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
        appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which
        appeared unto me at the first.

008:002 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I
        was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of
        Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.

008:003 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
        before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns
        were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher
        came up last.

008:004 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward;
        so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there
        any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according
        to his will, and became great.

008:005 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the
        west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the
        ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.

008:006 And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen
        standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his
        power.

008:007 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with
        choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two
        horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him,
        but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and
        there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.

008:008 Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was
        strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four
        notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.

008:009 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
        exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and
        toward the pleasant land.

008:010 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast
        down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and
        stamped upon them.

008:011 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and
        by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of
        the sanctuary was cast down.

008:012 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by
        reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the
        ground; and it practised, and prospered.

008:013 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto
        that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision
        concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of
        desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be
        trodden under foot?

008:014 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days;
        then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.

008:015 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the
        vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood
        before me as the appearance of a man.

008:016 And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which
        called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the
        vision.

008:017 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,
        and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son
        of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.

008:018 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my
        face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.

008:019 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in
        the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the
        end shall be.

008:020 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of
        Media and Persia.

008:021 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn
        that is between his eyes is the first king.

008:022 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
        kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his
        power.

008:023 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the
        transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce
        countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.

008:024 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and
        he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise,
        and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.

008:025 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in
        his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by
        peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the
        Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.

008:026 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told
        is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be
        for many days.

008:027 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I
        rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at
        the vision, but none understood it.

009:001 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed
        of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the
        Chaldeans;

009:002 In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books
        the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to
        Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years
        in the desolations of Jerusalem.

009:003 And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
        supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:

009:004 And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and
        said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant
        and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his
        commandments;

009:005 We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done
        wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy
        precepts and from thy judgments:

009:006 Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets,
        which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our
        fathers, and to all the people of the land.

009:007 O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us
        confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and
        to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are
        near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither
        thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they
        have trespassed against thee.

009:008 O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to
        our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned
        against thee.

009:009 To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though
        we have rebelled against him;

009:010 Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk
        in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the
        prophets.

009:011 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing,
        that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is
        poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of
        Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.

009:012 And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us,
        and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a
        great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as
        hath been done upon Jerusalem.

009:013 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come
        upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God,
        that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy
        truth.

009:014 Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it
        upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works
        which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.

009:015 And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth
        out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten
        thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done
        wickedly.

009:016 O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee,
        let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city
        Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for
        the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are
        become a reproach to all that are about us.

009:017 Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and
        his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy
        sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.

009:018 O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and
        behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy
        name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for
        our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.

009:019 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer
        not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people
        are called by thy name.

009:020 And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin
        and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my
        supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of
        my God;

009:021 Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel,
        whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused
        to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening
        oblation.

009:022 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I
        am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.

009:023 At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came
        forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly
        beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the
        vision.

009:024 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
        city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins,
        and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in
        everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and
        prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.

009:025 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of
        the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the
        Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and
        two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even
        in troublous times.

009:026 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off,
        but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall
        come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end
        thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war
        desolations are determined.

009:027 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and
        in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the
        oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations
        he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and
        that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

010:001 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed
        unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing
        was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood
        the thing, and had understanding of the vision.

010:002 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.

010:003 I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my
        mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole
        weeks were fulfilled.

010:004 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was
        by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;

010:005 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain
        man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold
        of Uphaz:

010:006 His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the
        appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and
        his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and
        the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.

010:007 And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with
        me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so
        that they fled to hide themselves.

010:008 Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and
        there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned
        in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.

010:009 Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice
        of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my
        face toward the ground.

010:010 And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees
        and upon the palms of my hands.

010:011 And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved,
        understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand
        upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken
        this word unto me, I stood trembling.

010:012 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day
        that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten
        thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come
        for thy words.

010:013 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
        twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came
        to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.

010:014 Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy
        people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many
        days.

010:015 And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face
        toward the ground, and I became dumb.

010:016 And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men
        touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said
        unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my
        sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.

010:017 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my
        lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in
        me, neither is there breath left in me.

010:018 Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance
        of a man, and he strengthened me,

010:019 And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee,
        be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I
        was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast
        strengthened me.

010:020 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now
        will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I
        am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.

010:021 But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of
        truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things,
        but Michael your prince.

011:001 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to
        confirm and to strengthen him.

011:002 And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand
        up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far
        richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches
        he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.

011:003 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great
        dominion, and do according to his will.

011:004 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and
        shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to
        his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled:
        for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside
        those.

011:005 And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his
        princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion;
        his dominion shall be a great dominion.

011:006 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together;
        for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of
        the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the
        power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she
        shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that
        begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.

011:007 But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his
        estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into
        the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against
        them, and shall prevail:

011:008 And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with
        their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and
        of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the
        north.

011:009 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and
        shall return into his own land.

011:010 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a
        multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and
        overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be
        stirred up, even to his fortress.

011:011 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and
        shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the
        north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the
        multitude shall be given into his hand.

011:012 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be
        lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he
        shall not be strengthened by it.

011:013 For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a
        multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come
        after certain years with a great army and with much riches.

011:014 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king
        of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt
        themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.

011:015 So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and
        take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall
        not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there
        be any strength to withstand.

011:016 But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own
        will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in
        the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.

011:017 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his
        whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do:
        and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her:
        but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.

011:018 After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall
        take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the
        reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he
        shall cause it to turn upon him.

011:019 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land:
        but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.

011:020 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the
        glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be
        destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.

011:021 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they
        shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in
        peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.

011:022 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from
        before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the
        covenant.

011:023 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully:
        for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small
        people.

011:024 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
        province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not
        done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them
        the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast
        his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.

011:025 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the
        king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south
        shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty
        army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices
        against him.

011:026 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
        him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down
        slain.

011:027 And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and
        they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper:
        for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.

011:028 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his
        heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do
        exploits, and return to his own land.

011:029 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the
        south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.

011:030 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he
        shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the
        holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have
        intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.

011:031 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
        sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily
        sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh
        desolate.

011:032 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt
        by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be
        strong, and do exploits.

011:033 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:
        yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity,
        and by spoil, many days.

011:034 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little
        help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.

011:035 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and
        to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end:
        because it is yet for a time appointed.

011:036 And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall
        exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall
        speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall
        prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is
        determined shall be done.

011:037 Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire
        of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself
        above all.

011:038 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god
        whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and
        silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.

011:039 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,
        whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he
        shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land
        for gain.

011:040 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at
        him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a
        whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many
        ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall
        overflow and pass over.

011:041 He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries
        shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand,
        even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.

011:042 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and
        the land of Egypt shall not escape.

011:043 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
        silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the
        Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.

011:044 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
        him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy,
        and utterly to make away many.

011:045 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the
        seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his
        end, and none shall help him.

012:001 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince
        which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall
        be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a
        nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people
        shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in
        the book.

012:002 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall
        awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
        everlasting contempt.

012:003 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
        firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the
        stars for ever and ever.

012:004 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even
        to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and
        knowledge shall be increased.

012:005 Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the
        one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on
        that side of the bank of the river.

012:006 And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the
        waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these
        wonders?

012:007 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the
        waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his
        left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever
        that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he
        shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy
        people, all these things shall be finished.

012:008 And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord,
        what shall be the end of these things?

012:009 And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up
        and sealed till the time of the end.

012:010 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the
        wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall
        understand; but the wise shall understand.

012:011 And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken
        away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there
        shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.

012:012 Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three
        hundred and five and thirty days.

012:013 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and
        stand in thy lot at the end of the days.

Book 28	Hosea

001:001 The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri,
        in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of
        Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of
        Israel.

001:002 The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD
        said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and
        children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great
        whoredom, departing from the LORD.

001:003 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which
        conceived, and bare him a son.

001:004 And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a
        little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the
        house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the
        house of Israel.

001:005 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the
        bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.

001:006 And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said
        unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have
        mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them
        away.

001:007 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save
        them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor
        by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.

001:008 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a
        son.

001:009 Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people,
        and I will not be your God.

001:010 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand
        of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it
        shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto
        them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them,
        Ye are the sons of the living God.

001:011 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be
        gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they
        shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of
        Jezreel.

002:001 Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.

002:002 Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither
        am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out
        of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;

002:003 Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was
        born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry
        land, and slay her with thirst.

002:004 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the
        children of whoredoms.

002:005 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived
        them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my
        lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my
        flax, mine oil and my drink.

002:006 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and
        make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.

002:007 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not
        overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find
        them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first
        husband; for then was it better with me than now.

002:008 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil,
        and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for
        Baal.

002:009 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time
        thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover
        my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.

002:010 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her
        lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.

002:011 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her
        new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.

002:012 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she
        hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me:
        and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field
        shall eat them.

002:013 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she
        burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her
        earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and
        forgat me, saith the LORD.

002:014 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
        wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.

002:015 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley
        of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in
        the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out
        of the land of Egypt.

002:016 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt
        call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.

002:017 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and
        they shall no more be remembered by their name.

002:018 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the
        beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the
        creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and
        the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them
        to lie down safely.

002:019 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth
        thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in
        lovingkindness, and in mercies.

002:020 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou
        shalt know the LORD.

002:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the
        LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;

002:022 And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil;
        and they shall hear Jezreel.

002:023 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy
        upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them
        which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall
        say, Thou art my God.

003:001 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of
        her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the
        LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods,
        and love flagons of wine.

003:002 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an
        homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:

003:003 And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou
        shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another
        man: so will I also be for thee.

003:004 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a
        king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and
        without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:

003:005 Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the
        LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD
        and his goodness in the latter days.

004:001 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD
        hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because
        there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the
        land.

004:002 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and
        committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.

004:003 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth
        therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with
        the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be
        taken away.

004:004 Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are
        as they that strive with the priest.

004:005 Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also
        shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy
        mother.

004:006 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou
        hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou
        shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law
        of thy God, I will also forget thy children.

004:007 As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore
        will I change their glory into shame.

004:008 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on
        their iniquity.

004:009 And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will
        punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.

004:010 For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit
        whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off
        to take heed to the LORD.

004:011 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.

004:012 My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff
        declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused
        them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their
        God.

004:013 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn
        incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms,
        because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters
        shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.

004:014 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom,
        nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are
        separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots:
        therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.

004:015 Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah
        offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to
        Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.

004:016 For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD
        will feed them as a lamb in a large place.

004:017 Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.

004:018 Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually:
        her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.

004:019 The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be
        ashamed because of their sacrifices.

005:001 Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and
        give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you,
        because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon
        Tabor.

005:002 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I
        have been a rebuker of them all.

005:003 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O
        Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.

005:004 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for
        the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have
        not known the LORD.

005:005 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore
        shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also
        shall fall with them.

005:006 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek
        the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn
        himself from them.

005:007 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have
        begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with
        their portions.

005:008 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry
        aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.

005:009 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the
        tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.

005:010 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:
        therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.

005:011 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he
        willingly walked after the commandment.

005:012 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house
        of Judah as rottenness.

005:013 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then
        went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet
        could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.

005:014 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to
        the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will
        take away, and none shall rescue him.

005:015 I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their
        offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek
        me early.

006:001 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and
        he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

006:002 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will
        raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.

006:003 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his
        going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto
        us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.

006:004 O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do
        unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the
        early dew it goeth away.

006:005 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them
        by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light
        that goeth forth.

006:006 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of
        God more than burnt offerings.

006:007 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have
        they dealt treacherously against me.

006:008 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted
        with blood.

006:009 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of
        priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit
        lewdness.

006:010 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is
        the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.

006:011 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I
        returned the captivity of my people.

007:001 When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim
        was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit
        falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers
        spoileth without.

007:002 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all
        their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about;
        they are before my face.

007:003 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes
        with their lies.

007:004 They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who
        ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it
        be leavened.

007:005 In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with
        bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.

007:006 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they
        lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the
        morning it burneth as a flaming fire.

007:007 They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges;
        all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that
        calleth unto me.

007:008 Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a
        cake not turned.

007:009 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not:
        yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth
        not.

007:010 And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do
        not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.

007:011 Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to
        Egypt, they go to Assyria.

007:012 When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will
        bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise
        them, as their congregation hath heard.

007:013 Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto
        them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have
        redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.

007:014 And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they
        howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and
        wine, and they rebel against me.

007:015 Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they
        imagine mischief against me.

007:016 They return, but not to the most High: they are like a
        deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the
        rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land
        of Egypt.

008:001 Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle
        against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed
        my covenant, and trespassed against my law.

008:002 Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.

008:003 Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall
        pursue him.

008:004 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes,
        and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they
        made them idols, that they may be cut off.

008:005 Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled
        against them: how long will it be ere they attain to
        innocency?

008:006 For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it
        is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.

008:007 For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the
        whirlwind: it hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if
        so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.

008:008 Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles
        as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.

008:009 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself:
        Ephraim hath hired lovers.

008:010 Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I
        gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of
        the king of princes.

008:011 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be
        unto him to sin.

008:012 I have written to him the great things of my law, but they
        were counted as a strange thing.

008:013 They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and
        eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember
        their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to
        Egypt.

008:014 For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and
        Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire
        upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.

009:001 Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast
        gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon
        every cornfloor.

009:002 The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new
        wine shall fail in her.

009:003 They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall
        return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.

009:004 They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall
        they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them
        as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be
        polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into
        the house of the LORD.

009:005 What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast
        of the LORD?

009:006 For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall
        gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places
        for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be
        in their tabernacles.

009:007 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are
        come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the
        spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and
        the great hatred.

009:008 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a
        snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of
        his God.

009:009 They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of
        Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will
        visit their sins.

009:010 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your
        fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time:
        but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that
        shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.

009:011 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from
        the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.

009:012 Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them,
        that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when
        I depart from them!

009:013 Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but
        Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.

009:014 Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a
        miscarrying womb and dry breasts.

009:015 All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for
        the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine
        house, I will love them no more: all their princes are
        revolters.

009:016 Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no
        fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the
        beloved fruit of their womb.

009:017 My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto
        him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.

010:001 Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself:
        according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the
        altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made
        goodly images.

010:002 Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he
        shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.

010:003 For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not
        the LORD; what then should a king do to us?

010:004 They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant:
        thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the
        field.

010:005 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of
        Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the
        priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof,
        because it is departed from it.

010:006 It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king
        Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be
        ashamed of his own counsel.

010:007 As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the
        water.

010:008 The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be
        destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their
        altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to
        the hills, Fall on us.

010:009 O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they
        stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity
        did not overtake them.

010:010 It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people
        shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind
        themselves in their two furrows.

010:011 And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to
        tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I
        will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall
        break his clods.

010:012 Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up
        your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he
        come and rain righteousness upon you.

010:013 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have
        eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way,
        in the multitude of thy mighty men.

010:014 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy
        fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in
        the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her
        children.

010:015 So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness:
        in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.

011:001 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son
        out of Egypt.

011:002 As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed
        unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

011:003 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but
        they knew not that I healed them.

011:004 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was
        to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I
        laid meat unto them.

011:005 He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian
        shall be his king, because they refused to return.

011:006 And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his
        branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.

011:007 And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they
        called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.

011:008 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee,
        Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee
        as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are
        kindled together.

011:009 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not
        return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy
        One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.

011:010 They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion:
        when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the
        west.

011:011 They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out
        of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses,
        saith the LORD.

011:012 Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel
        with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful
        with the saints.

012:001 Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he
        daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a
        covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.

012:002 The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish
        Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he
        recompense him.

012:003 He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his
        strength he had power with God:

012:004 Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and
        made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there
        he spake with us;

012:005 Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.

012:006 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and
        wait on thy God continually.

012:007 He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he
        loveth to oppress.

012:008 And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out
        substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in
        me that were sin.

012:009 And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet
        make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the
        solemn feast.

012:010 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied
        visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the
        prophets.

012:011 Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they
        sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps
        in the furrows of the fields.

012:012 And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served
        for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.

012:013 And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by
        a prophet was he preserved.

012:014 Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall
        he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD
        return unto him.

013:001 When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel;
        but when he offended in Baal, he died.

013:002 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten
        images of their silver, and idols according to their own
        understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say
        of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.

013:003 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early
        dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the
        whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the
        chimney.

013:004 Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou
        shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.

013:005 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great
        drought.

013:006 According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were
        filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they
        forgotten me.

013:007 Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the
        way will I observe them:

013:008 I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and
        will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour
        them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.

013:009 O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine
        help.

013:010 I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in
        all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a
        king and princes?

013:011 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my
        wrath.

013:012 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.

013:013 The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is
        an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the
        breaking forth of children.

013:014 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem
        them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I
        will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine
        eyes.

013:015 Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall
        come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness,
        and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be
        dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.

013:016 Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against
        her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be
        dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped
        up.

014:001 O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen
        by thine iniquity.

014:002 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take
        away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we
        render the calves of our lips.

014:003 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses:
        neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are
        our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.

014:004 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for
        mine anger is turned away from him.

014:005 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily,
        and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.

014:006 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the
        olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.

014:007 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall
        revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof
        shall be as the wine of Lebanon.

014:008 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I
        have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree.
        From me is thy fruit found.

014:009 Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent,
        and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right,
        and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall
        fall therein.

Book 29	Joel

001:001 The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.

001:002 Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
        land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your
        fathers?

001:003 Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their
        children, and their children another generation.

001:004 That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and
        that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and
        that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller
        eaten.

001:005 Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of
        wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your
        mouth.

001:006 For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without
        number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the
        cheek teeth of a great lion.

001:007 He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath
        made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are
        made white.

001:008 Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of
        her youth.

001:009 The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the
        house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn.

001:010 The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is
        wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.

001:011 Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for
        the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field
        is perished.

001:012 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the
        pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even
        all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is
        withered away from the sons of men.

001:013 Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of
        the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of
        my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is
        withholden from the house of your God.

001:014 Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders
        and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD
        your God, and cry unto the LORD,

001:015 Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a
        destruction from the Almighty shall it come.

001:016 Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness
        from the house of our God?

001:017 The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid
        desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.

001:018 How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed,
        because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are
        made desolate.

001:019 O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the
        pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the
        trees of the field.

001:020 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of
        waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures
        of the wilderness.

002:001 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
        mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the
        day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;

002:002 A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of
        thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a
        great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like,
        neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many
        generations.

002:003 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth:
        the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them
        a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.

002:004 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as
        horsemen, so shall they run.

002:005 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they
        leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the
        stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.

002:006 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces
        shall gather blackness.

002:007 They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like
        men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and
        they shall not break their ranks:

002:008 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in
        his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be
        wounded.

002:009 They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the
        wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in
        at the windows like a thief.

002:010 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble:
        the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall
        withdraw their shining:

002:011 And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his
        camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word:
        for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who
        can abide it?

002:012 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with
        all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
        mourning:

002:013 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the
        LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger,
        and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.

002:014 Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing
        behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the
        LORD your God?

002:015 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn
        assembly:

002:016 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the
        elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts:
        let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out
        of her closet.

002:017 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the
        porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O
        LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the
        heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among
        the people, Where is their God?

002:018 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his
        people.

002:019 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I
        will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be
        satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach
        among the heathen:

002:020 But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will
        drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face
        toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost
        sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall
        come up, because he hath done great things.

002:021 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do
        great things.

002:022 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the
        wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig
        tree and the vine do yield their strength.

002:023 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD
        your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately,
        and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former
        rain, and the latter rain in the first month.

002:024 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall
        overflow with wine and oil.

002:025 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath
        eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the
        palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.

002:026 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the
        name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with
        you: and my people shall never be ashamed.

002:027 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I
        am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never
        be ashamed.

002:028 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my
        spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall
        prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men
        shall see visions:

002:029 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those
        days will I pour out my spirit.

002:030 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth,
        blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.

002:031 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into
        blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.

002:032 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the
        name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in
        Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in
        the remnant whom the LORD shall call.

003:001 For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall
        bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,

003:002 I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into
        the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for
        my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered
        among the nations, and parted my land.

003:003 And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy
        for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might
        drink.

003:004 Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and
        all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence?
        and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return
        your recompence upon your own head;

003:005 Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried
        into your temples my goodly pleasant things:

003:006 The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have
        ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from
        their border.

003:007 Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have
        sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:

003:008 And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of
        the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the
        Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken it.

003:009 Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the
        mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come
        up:

003:010 Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into
        spears: let the weak say, I am strong.

003:011 Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather
        yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones
        to come down, O LORD.

003:012 Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of
        Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen
        round about.

003:013 Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you
        down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their
        wickedness is great.

003:014 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day
        of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.

003:015 The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall
        withdraw their shining.

003:016 The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from
        Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the
        LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the
        children of Israel.

003:017 So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion,
        my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there
        shall no strangers pass through her any more.

003:018 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains
        shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk,
        and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a
        fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and
        shall water the valley of Shittim.

003:019 Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate
        wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah,
        because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

003:020 But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation
        to generation.

003:021 For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for
        the LORD dwelleth in Zion.

Book 30	Amos

001:001 The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which
        he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah,
        and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel,
        two years before the earthquake.

001:002 And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice
        from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall
        mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.

001:003 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and
        for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:

001:004 But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall
        devour the palaces of Benhadad.

001:005 I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the
        inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the
        sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall
        go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.

001:006 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for
        four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them
        up to Edom:

001:007 But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour
        the palaces thereof:

001:008 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that
        holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand
        against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall
        perish, saith the Lord GOD.

001:009 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and
        for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered
        not the brotherly covenant:

001:010 But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall
        devour the palaces thereof.

001:011 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for
        four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he
        did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all
        pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his
        wrath for ever:

001:012 But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the
        palaces of Bozrah.

001:013 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children
        of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment
        thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of
        Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:

001:014 But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall
        devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of
        battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:

001:015 And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes
        together, saith the LORD.

002:001 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for
        four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he
        burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:

002:002 But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the
        palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with
        shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:

002:003 And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will
        slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.

002:004 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and
        for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his
        commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the
        which their fathers have walked:

002:005 But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the
        palaces of Jerusalem.

002:006 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and
        for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of
        shoes;

002:007 That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor,
        and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father
        will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:

002:008 And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by
        every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the
        house of their god.

002:009 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like
        the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I
        destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

002:010 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you
        forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the
        Amorite.

002:011 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young
        men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of
        Israel? saith the LORD.

002:012 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the
        prophets, saying, Prophesy not.

002:013 Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is
        full of sheaves.

002:014 Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the
        strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the
        mighty deliver himself:

002:015 Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is
        swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that
        rideth the horse deliver himself.

002:016 And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away
        naked in that day, saith the LORD.

003:001 Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O
        children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought
        up from the land of Egypt, saying,

003:002 You only have I known of all the families of the earth:
        therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.

003:003 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?

003:004 Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a
        young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?

003:005 Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for
        him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken
        nothing at all?

003:006 Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be
        afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not
        done it?

003:007 Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his
        secret unto his servants the prophets.

003:008 The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath
        spoken, who can but prophesy?

003:009 Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the
        land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains
        of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof,
        and the oppressed in the midst thereof.

003:010 For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up
        violence and robbery in their palaces.

003:011 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be
        even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy
        strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.

003:012 Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth
        of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the
        children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the
        corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.

003:013 Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord
        GOD, the God of hosts,

003:014 That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of
        Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and
        the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the
        ground.

003:015 And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and
        the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall
        have an end, saith the LORD.

004:001 Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of
        Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which
        say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.

004:002 The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days
        shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks,
        and your posterity with fishhooks.

004:003 And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which
        is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith
        the LORD.

004:004 Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply
        transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and
        your tithes after three years:

004:005 And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and
        proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you,
        O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

004:006 And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your
        cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not
        returned unto me, saith the LORD.

004:007 And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were
        yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon
        one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one
        piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not
        withered.

004:008 So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water;
        but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me,
        saith the LORD.

004:009 I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens
        and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees
        increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not
        returned unto me, saith the LORD.

004:010 I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of
        Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have
        taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your
        camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned
        unto me, saith the LORD.

004:011 I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and
        Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the
        burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

004:012 Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I
        will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

004:013 For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind,
        and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the
        morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the
        earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.

005:001 Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a
        lamentation, O house of Israel.

005:002 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is
        forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.

005:003 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a
        thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by
        an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.

005:004 For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me,
        and ye shall live:

005:005 But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to
        Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and
        Bethel shall come to nought.

005:006 Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire
        in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to
        quench it in Bethel.

005:007 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness
        in the earth,

005:008 Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth
        the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark
        with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and
        poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his
        name:

005:009 That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the
        spoiled shall come against the fortress.

005:010 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him
        that speaketh uprightly.

005:011 Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye
        take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn
        stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted
        pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.

005:012 For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins:
        they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside
        the poor in the gate from their right.

005:013 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it
        is an evil time.

005:014 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD,
        the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.

005:015 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in
        the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be
        gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.

005:016 Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus;
        Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the
        highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to
        mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.

005:017 And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through
        thee, saith the LORD.

005:018 Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is
        it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.

005:019 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went
        into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent
        bit him.

005:020 Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even
        very dark, and no brightness in it?

005:021 I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in
        your solemn assemblies.

005:022 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I
        will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace
        offerings of your fat beasts.

005:023 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not
        hear the melody of thy viols.

005:024 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a
        mighty stream.

005:025 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the
        wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?

005:026 But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your
        images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.

005:027 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond
        Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.

006:001 Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the
        mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to
        whom the house of Israel came!

006:002 Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath
        the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they
        better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your
        border?

006:003 Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of
        violence to come near;

006:004 That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their
        couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves
        out of the midst of the stall;

006:005 That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves
        instruments of musick, like David;

006:006 That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief
        ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of
        Joseph.

006:007 Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go
        captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves
        shall be removed.

006:008 The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of
        hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces:
        therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.

006:009 And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one
        house, that they shall die.

006:010 And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him,
        to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto
        him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with
        thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy
        tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.

006:011 For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great
        house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.

006:012 Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen?
        for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of
        righteousness into hemlock:

006:013 Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not
        taken to us horns by our own strength?

006:014 But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of
        Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall
        afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of
        the wilderness.

007:001 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed
        grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter
        growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's
        mowings.

007:002 And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating
        the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I
        beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.

007:003 The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.

007:004 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord
        GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep,
        and did eat up a part.

007:005 Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall
        Jacob arise? for he is small.

007:006 The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the
        Lord GOD.

007:007 Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall
        made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.

007:008 And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said,
        A plumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a
        plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again
        pass by them any more:

007:009 And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the
        sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise
        against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.

007:010 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of
        Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst
        of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his
        words.

007:011 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and
        Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.

007:012 Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away
        into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy
        there:

007:013 But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the
        king's chapel, and it is the king's court.

007:014 Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet,
        neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a
        gatherer of sycomore fruit:

007:015 And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD
        said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.

007:016 Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest,
        Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the
        house of Isaac.

007:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in
        the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the
        sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt
        die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into
        captivity forth of his land.

008:001 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of
        summer fruit.

008:002 And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of
        summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon
        my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.

008:003 And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day,
        saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every
        place; they shall cast them forth with silence.

008:004 Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the
        poor of the land to fail,

008:005 Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn?
        and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah
        small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by
        deceit?

008:006 That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair
        of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?

008:007 The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will
        never forget any of their works.

008:008 Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that
        dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and
        it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.

008:009 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD,
        that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will
        darken the earth in the clear day:

008:010 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs
        into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all
        loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the
        mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.

008:011 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a
        famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for
        water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:

008:012 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even
        to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the
        LORD, and shall not find it.

008:013 In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for
        thirst.

008:014 They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O
        Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they
        shall fall, and never rise up again.

009:001 I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the
        lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in
        the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with
        the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he
        that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.

009:002 Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them;
        though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:

009:003 And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will
        search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from
        my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the
        serpent, and he shall bite them:

009:004 And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence
        will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will
        set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.

009:005 And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it
        shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it
        shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by
        the flood of Egypt.

009:006 It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath
        founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters
        of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth:
        The LORD is his name.

009:007 Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children
        of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of
        the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the
        Syrians from Kir?

009:008 Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom,
        and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving
        that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the
        LORD.

009:009 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel
        among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet
        shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.

009:010 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which
        say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.

009:011 In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is
        fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up
        his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:

009:012 That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the
        heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that
        doeth this.

009:013 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall
        overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth
        seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the
        hills shall melt.

009:014 And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel,
        and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and
        they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they
        shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

009:015 And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more
        be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith
        the LORD thy God.

Book 31	Obadiah

001:001 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning
        Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador
        is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up
        against her in battle.

001:002 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art
        greatly despised.

001:003 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that
        dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high;
        that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the
        ground?

001:004 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set
        thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith
        the LORD.

001:005 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou
        cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if
        the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some
        grapes?

001:006 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden
        things sought up!

001:007 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the
        border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived
        thee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy bread have
        laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.

001:008 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise
        men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?

001:009 And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end
        that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by
        slaughter.

001:010 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover
        thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.

001:011 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day
        that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and
        foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon
        Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.

001:012 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother
        in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou
        have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their
        destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the
        day of distress.

001:013 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in
        the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked
        on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have
        laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;

001:014 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off
        those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have
        delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of
        distress.

001:015 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou
        hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return
        upon thine own head.

001:016 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the
        heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they
        shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not
        been.

001:017 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be
        holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their
        possessions.

001:018 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of
        Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they
        shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be
        any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken
        it.

001:019 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and
        they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the
        fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin
        shall possess Gilead.

001:020 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall
        possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the
        captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess
        the cities of the south.

001:021 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of
        Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.

Book 32	Jonah

001:001 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,
        saying,

001:002 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for
        their wickedness is come up before me.

001:003 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of
        the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to
        Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it,
        to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.

001:004 But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was
        a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be
        broken.

001:005 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his
        god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the
        sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the
        sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.

001:006 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest
        thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God
        will think upon us, that we perish not.

001:007 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast
        lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.
        So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

001:008 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose
        cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and
        whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people
        art thou?

001:009 And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD,
        the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.

001:010 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why
        hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the
        presence of the LORD, because he had told them.

001:011 Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the
        sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was
        tempestuous.

001:012 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the
        sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my
        sake this great tempest is upon you.

001:013 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but
        they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous
        against them.

001:014 Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee,
        O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's
        life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD,
        hast done as it pleased thee.

001:015 So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and
        the sea ceased from her raging.

001:016 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a
        sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.

001:017 Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.
        And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three
        nights.

002:001 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's
        belly,

002:002 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD,
        and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou
        heardest my voice.

002:003 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the
        seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and
        thy waves passed over me.

002:004 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again
        toward thy holy temple.

002:005 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth
        closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.

002:006 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with
        her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my
        life from corruption, O LORD my God.

002:007 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my
        prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.

002:008 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

002:009 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving;
        I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.

002:010 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah
        upon the dry land.

003:001 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time,
        saying,

003:002 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it
        the preaching that I bid thee.

003:003 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word
        of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three
        days' journey.

003:004 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he
        cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
        overthrown.

003:005 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
        and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the
        least of them.

003:006 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
        throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with
        sackcloth, and sat in ashes.

003:007 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through
        Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let
        neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let
        them not feed, nor drink water:

003:008 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
        mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil
        way, and from the violence that is in their hands.

003:009 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from
        his fierce anger, that we perish not?

003:010 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way;
        and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would
        do unto them; and he did it not.

004:001 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

004:002 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD,
        was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country?
        Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou
        art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
        kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.

004:003 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me;
        for it is better for me to die than to live.

004:004 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?

004:005 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the
        city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the
        shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.

004:006 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over
        Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him
        from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.

004:007 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day,
        and it smote the gourd that it withered.

004:008 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared
        a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah,
        that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is
        better for me to die than to live.

004:009 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the
        gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.

004:010 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the
        which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which
        came up in a night, and perished in a night:

004:011 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are
        more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern
        between their right hand and their left hand; and also much
        cattle?

Book 33	Micah

001:001 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the
        days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he
        saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

001:002 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein
        is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from
        his holy temple.

001:003 For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will
        come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.

001:004 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys
        shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that
        are poured down a steep place.

001:005 For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins
        of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is
        it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are
        they not Jerusalem?

001:006 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as
        plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones
        thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations
        thereof.

001:007 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces,
        and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and
        all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it
        of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of
        an harlot.

001:008 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked:
        I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the
        owls.

001:009 For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is
        come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.

001:010 Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of
        Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.

001:011 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame
        naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning
        of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.

001:012 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but
        evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.

001:013 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift
        beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of
        Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.

001:014 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the
        houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.

001:015 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah:
        he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.

001:016 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children;
        enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into
        captivity from thee.

002:001 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their
        beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it
        is in the power of their hand.

002:002 And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses,
        and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even
        a man and his heritage.

002:003 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do
        I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks;
        neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.

002:004 In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and
        lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly
        spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he
        removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.

002:005 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot
        in the congregation of the LORD.

002:006 Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall
        not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.

002:007 O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the
        LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good
        to him that walketh uprightly?

002:008 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off
        the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as
        men averse from war.

002:009 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant
        houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for
        ever.

002:010 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is
        polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.

002:011 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I
        will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall
        even be the prophet of this people.

002:012 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely
        gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the
        sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they
        shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.

002:013 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and
        have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and
        their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of
        them.

003:001 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes
        of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?

003:002 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin
        from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

003:003 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from
        off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces,
        as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

003:004 Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them:
        he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they
        have behaved themselves ill in their doings.

003:005 Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my
        people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he
        that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war
        against him.

003:006 Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a
        vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not
        divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the
        day shall be dark over them.

003:007 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded:
        yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer
        of God.

003:008 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of
        judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his
        transgression, and to Israel his sin.

003:009 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and
        princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and
        pervert all equity.

003:010 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

003:011 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof
        teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet
        will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among
        us? none evil can come upon us.

003:012 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and
        Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as
        the high places of the forest.

004:001 But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain
        of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of
        the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and
        people shall flow unto it.

004:002 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up
        to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of
        Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in
        his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of
        the LORD from Jerusalem.

004:003 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong
        nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into
        plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall
        not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn
        war any more.

004:004 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig
        tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the
        LORD of hosts hath spoken it.

004:005 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and
        we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and
        ever.

004:006 In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth,
        and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have
        afflicted;

004:007 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was
        cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over
        them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.

004:008 And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the
        daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first
        dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.

004:009 Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is
        thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman
        in travail.

004:010 Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion,
        like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of
        the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go
        even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD
        shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.

004:011 Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let
        her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.

004:012 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand
        they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into
        the floor.

004:013 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine
        horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt
        beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain
        unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole
        earth.

005:001 Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath
        laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel
        with a rod upon the cheek.

005:002 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
        thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto
        me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been
        from of old, from everlasting.

005:003 Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which
        travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his
        brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.

005:004 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in
        the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall
        abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.

005:005 And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come
        into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then
        shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight
        principal men.

005:006 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and
        the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he
        deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land,
        and when he treadeth within our borders.

005:007 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people
        as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that
        tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.

005:008 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the
        midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest,
        as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go
        through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none
        can deliver.

005:009 Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all
        thine enemies shall be cut off.

005:010 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I
        will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will
        destroy thy chariots:

005:011 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all
        thy strong holds:

005:012 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou
        shalt have no more soothsayers:

005:013 Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images
        out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the
        work of thine hands.

005:014 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so
        will I destroy thy cities.

005:015 And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the
        heathen, such as they have not heard.

006:001 Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before
        the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.

006:002 Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong
        foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with
        his people, and he will plead with Israel.

006:003 O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I
        wearied thee? testify against me.

006:004 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
        thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee
        Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

006:005 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted,
        and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto
        Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.

006:006 Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before
        the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
        with calves of a year old?

006:007 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten
        thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my
        transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

006:008 He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the
        LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and
        to walk humbly with thy God?

006:009 The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom
        shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed
        it.

006:010 Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the
        wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?

006:011 Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the
        bag of deceitful weights?

006:012 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the
        inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is
        deceitful in their mouth.

006:013 Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in
        making thee desolate because of thy sins.

006:014 Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down
        shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but
        shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give
        up to the sword.

006:015 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the
        olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet
        wine, but shalt not drink wine.

006:016 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the
        house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should
        make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an
        hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.

007:001 Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer
        fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no
        cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.

007:002 The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none
        upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt
        every man his brother with a net.

007:003 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince
        asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man,
        he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.

007:004 The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper
        than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation
        cometh; now shall be their perplexity.

007:005 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide:
        keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.

007:006 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up
        against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in
        law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.

007:007 Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God
        of my salvation: my God will hear me.

007:008 Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall
        arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto
        me.

007:009 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned
        against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for
        me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold
        his righteousness.

007:010 Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall
        cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine
        eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the
        mire of the streets.

007:011 In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall
        the decree be far removed.

007:012 In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and
        from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the
        river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.

007:013 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them
        that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.

007:014 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage,
        which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel:
        let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

007:015 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt
        will I shew unto him marvellous things.

007:016 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might:
        they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall
        be deaf.

007:017 They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out
        of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid
        of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.

007:018 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and
        passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?
        he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in
        mercy.

007:019 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will
        subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into
        the depths of the sea.

007:020 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to
        Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days
        of old.

Book 34	Nahum

001:001 The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the
        Elkoshite.

001:002 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth,
        and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his
        adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.

001:003 The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at
        all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind
        and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

001:004 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the
        rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of
        Lebanon languisheth.

001:005 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth
        is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell
        therein.

001:006 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the
        fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and
        the rocks are thrown down by him.

001:007 The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he
        knoweth them that trust in him.

001:008 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the
        place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.

001:009 What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter
        end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.

001:010 For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they
        are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble
        fully dry.

001:011 There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the
        LORD, a wicked counsellor.

001:012 Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many,
        yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through.
        Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.

001:013 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst
        thy bonds in sunder.

001:014 And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no
        more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I
        cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy
        grave; for thou art vile.

001:015 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
        tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn
        feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass
        through thee; he is utterly cut off.

002:001 He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the
        munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy
        power mightily.

002:002 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the
        excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out,
        and marred their vine branches.

002:003 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are
        in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the
        day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly
        shaken.

002:004 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one
        against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like
        torches, they shall run like the lightnings.

002:005 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their
        walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the
        defence shall be prepared.

002:006 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall
        be dissolved.

002:007 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up,
        and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves,
        tabering upon their breasts.

002:008 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall
        flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look
        back.

002:009 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there
        is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant
        furniture.

002:010 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and
        the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and
        the faces of them all gather blackness.

002:011 Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of
        the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked,
        and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?

002:012 The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and
        strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey,
        and his dens with ravin.

002:013 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will
        burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy
        young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and
        the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.

003:001 Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery;
        the prey departeth not;

003:002 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the
        wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping
        chariots.

003:003 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the
        glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a
        great number of carcases; and there is none end of their
        corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:

003:004 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured
        harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations
        through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.

003:005 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will
        discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations
        thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.

003:006 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee
        vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.

003:007 And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee
        shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will
        bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?

003:008 Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the
        rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was
        the sea, and her wall was from the sea?

003:009 Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put
        and Lubim were thy helpers.

003:010 Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young
        children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the
        streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all
        her great men were bound in chains.

003:011 Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt
        seek strength because of the enemy.

003:012 All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the
        firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into
        the mouth of the eater.

003:013 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates
        of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the
        fire shall devour thy bars.

003:014 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go
        into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.

003:015 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee
        off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself
        many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.

003:016 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven:
        the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.

003:017 Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great
        grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but
        when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not
        known where they are.

003:018 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall
        dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains,
        and no man gathereth them.

003:019 There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all
        that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee:
        for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?

Book 35	Habakkuk

001:001 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.

001:002 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry
        out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!

001:003 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold
        grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there
        are that raise up strife and contention.

001:004 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go
        forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous;
        therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.

001:005 Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder
        marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will
        not believe, though it be told you.

001:006 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty
        nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to
        possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's.

001:007 They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their
        dignity shall proceed of themselves.

001:008 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more
        fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall
        spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far;
        they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.

001:009 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as
        the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the
        sand.

001:010 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a
        scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they
        shall heap dust, and take it.

001:011 Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and
        offend, imputing this his power unto his god.

001:012 Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?
        we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for
        judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for
        correction.

001:013 Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look
        on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal
        treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked
        devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?

001:014 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping
        things, that have no ruler over them?

001:015 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in
        their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they
        rejoice and are glad.

001:016 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto
        their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their
        meat plenteous.

001:017 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare
        continually to slay the nations?

002:001 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and
        will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall
        answer when I am reproved.

002:002 And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make
        it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.

002:003 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it
        shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it;
        because it will surely come, it will not tarry.

002:004 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but
        the just shall live by his faith.

002:005 Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man,
        neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and
        is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him
        all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:

002:006 Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a
        taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that
        increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that
        ladeth himself with thick clay!

002:007 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and
        awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto
        them?

002:008 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the
        people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the
        violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell
        therein.

002:009 Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house,
        that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered
        from the power of evil!

002:010 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many
        people, and hast sinned against thy soul.

002:011 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of
        the timber shall answer it.

002:012 Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a
        city by iniquity!

002:013 Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall
        labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves
        for very vanity?

002:014 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory
        of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.

002:015 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy
        bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest
        look on their nakedness!

002:016 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let
        thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand
        shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on
        thy glory.

002:017 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of
        beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and
        for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that
        dwell therein.

002:018 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath
        graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the
        maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?

002:019 Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone,
        Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and
        silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

002:020 But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep
        silence before him.

003:001 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.

003:002 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD,
        revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the
        years make known; in wrath remember mercy.

003:003 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah.
        His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his
        praise.

003:004 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out
        of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.

003:005 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth
        at his feet.

003:006 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder
        the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the
        perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.

003:007 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of
        the land of Midian did tremble.

003:008 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger
        against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou
        didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?

003:009 Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the
        tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with
        rivers.

003:010 The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of
        the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up
        his hands on high.

003:011 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light
        of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy
        glittering spear.

003:012 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst
        thresh the heathen in anger.

003:013 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for
        salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of
        the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto
        the neck. Selah.

003:014 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his
        villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their
        rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.

003:015 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the
        heap of great waters.

003:016 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the
        voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in
        myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he
        cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his
        troops.

003:017 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit
        be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the
        fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from
        the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:

003:018 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my
        salvation.

003:019 The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like
        hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high
        places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.

Book 36	Zephaniah

001:001 The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of
        Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of
        Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.

001:002 I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the
        LORD.

001:003 I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the
        heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks
        with the wicked: and I will cut off man from off the land,
        saith the LORD.

001:004 I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the
        inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of
        Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the
        priests;

001:005 And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops;
        and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that
        swear by Malcham;

001:006 And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that
        have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.

001:007 Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of
        the LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice,
        he hath bid his guests.

001:008 And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice,
        that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and
        all such as are clothed with strange apparel.

001:009 In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the
        threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and
        deceit.

001:010 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that
        there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an
        howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.

001:011 Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people
        are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.

001:012 And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search
        Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on
        their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do
        good, neither will he do evil.

001:013 Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a
        desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit
        them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine
        thereof.

001:014 The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth
        greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man
        shall cry there bitterly.

001:015 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a
        day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and
        gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,

001:016 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and
        against the high towers.

001:017 And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like
        blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and
        their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as
        the dung.

001:018 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver
        them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall
        be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make
        even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.

002:001 Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not
        desired;

002:002 Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the
        chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you,
        before the day of the LORD's anger come upon you.

002:003 Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought
        his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye
        shall be hid in the day of the LORD's anger.

002:004 For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they
        shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be
        rooted up.

002:005 Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the
        Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan,
        the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that
        there shall be no inhabitant.

002:006 And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for
        shepherds, and folds for flocks.

002:007 And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah;
        they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall
        they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall
        visit them, and turn away their captivity.

002:008 I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the
        children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and
        magnified themselves against their border.

002:009 Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
        Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of
        Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits,
        and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall
        spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.

002:010 This shall they have for their pride, because they have
        reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the
        LORD of hosts.

002:011 The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all
        the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one
        from his place, even all the isles of the heathen.

002:012 Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.

002:013 And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and
        destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry
        like a wilderness.

002:014 And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts
        of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge
        in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the
        windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall
        uncover the cedar work.

002:015 This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in
        her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she
        become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every
        one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.

003:001 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing
        city!

003:002 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she
        trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.

003:003 Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are
        evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.

003:004 Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests
        have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the
        law.

003:005 The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do
        iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light,
        he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.

003:006 I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made
        their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are
        destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none
        inhabitant.

003:007 I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive
        instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off,
        howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted
        all their doings.

003:008 Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that
        I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the
        nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them
        mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth
        shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.

003:009 For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they
        may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one
        consent.

003:010 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the
        daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.

003:011 In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings,
        wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will
        take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy
        pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy
        mountain.

003:012 I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor
        people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.

003:013 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies;
        neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for
        they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

003:014 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice
        with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.

003:015 The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine
        enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of
        thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.

003:016 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and
        to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.

003:017 The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save,
        he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love,
        he will joy over thee with singing.

003:018 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly,
        who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.

003:019 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I
        will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven
        out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where
        they have been put to shame.

003:020 At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I
        gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all
        people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before
        your eyes, saith the LORD.

Book 37	Haggai

001:001 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in
        the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by
        Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
        governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high
        priest, saying,

001:002 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The
        time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be
        built.

001:003 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

001:004 Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and
        this house lie waste?

001:005 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your
        ways.

001:006 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have
        not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye
        clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages
        earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.

001:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

001:008 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house;
        and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith
        the LORD.

001:009 Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye
        brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of
        hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every
        man unto his own house.

001:010 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the
        earth is stayed from her fruit.

001:011 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the
        mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon
        the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and
        upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the
        hands.

001:012 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
        Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people,
        obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of
        Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and
        the people did fear before the LORD.

001:013 Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message
        unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.

001:014 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
        Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son
        of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the
        remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house
        of the LORD of hosts, their God,

001:015 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the
        second year of Darius the king.

002:001 In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the
        month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai,
        saying,

002:002 Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of
        Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and
        to the residue of the people, saying,

002:003 Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory?
        and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison
        of it as nothing?

002:004 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be
        strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be
        strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work:
        for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:

002:005 According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came
        out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.

002:006 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little
        while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the
        sea, and the dry land;

002:007 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations
        shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the
        LORD of hosts.

002:008 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of
        hosts.

002:009 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the
        former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give
        peace, saith the LORD of hosts.

002:010 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the
        second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the
        prophet, saying,

002:011 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning
        the law, saying,

002:012 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with
        his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any
        meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

002:013 Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch
        any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered
        and said, It shall be unclean.

002:014 Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is
        this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of
        their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.

002:015 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from
        before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the
        LORD:

002:016 Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty
        measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat
        for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but
        twenty.

002:017 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all
        the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the
        LORD.

002:018 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and
        twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the
        foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it.

002:019 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig
        tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not
        brought forth: from this day will I bless you.

002:020 And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four
        and twentieth day of the month, saying,

002:021 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake
        the heavens and the earth;

002:022 And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will
        destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I
        will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and
        the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the
        sword of his brother.

002:023 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O
        Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD,
        and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith
        the LORD of hosts.

Book 38	Zechariah

001:001 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the
        word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son
        of Iddo the prophet, saying,

001:002 The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.

001:003 Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
        Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto
        you, saith the LORD of hosts.

001:004 Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have
        cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from
        your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not
        hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.

001:005 Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live
        for ever?

001:006 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants
        the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they
        returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do
        unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings,
        so hath he dealt with us.

001:007 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which
        is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the
        word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son
        of Iddo the prophet, saying,

001:008 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and
        he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and
        behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.

001:009 Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that
        talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.

001:010 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and
        said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and
        fro through the earth.

001:011 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the
        myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the
        earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at
        rest.

001:012 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts,
        how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the
        cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these
        threescore and ten years?

001:013 And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good
        words and comfortable words.

001:014 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou,
        saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for
        Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.

001:015 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at
        ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped
        forward the affliction.

001:016 Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with
        mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of
        hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.

001:017 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities
        through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD
        shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.

001:018 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.

001:019 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these?
        And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered
        Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.

001:020 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.

001:021 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying,
        These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man
        did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast
        out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over
        the land of Judah to scatter it.

002:001 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with
        a measuring line in his hand.

002:002 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To
        measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and
        what is the length thereof.

002:003 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and
        another angel went out to meet him,

002:004 And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying,
        Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the
        multitude of men and cattle therein:

002:005 For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round
        about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.

002:006 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith
        the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of
        the heaven, saith the LORD.

002:007 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of
        Babylon.

002:008 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent
        me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth
        you toucheth the apple of his eye.

002:009 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall
        be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD
        of hosts hath sent me.

002:010 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I
        will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.

002:011 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and
        shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and
        thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.

002:012 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land,
        and shall choose Jerusalem again.

002:013 Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up
        out of his holy habitation.

003:001 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the
        angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to
        resist him.

003:002 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan;
        even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not
        this a brand plucked out of the fire?

003:003 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before
        the angel.

003:004 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him,
        saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him
        he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from
        thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.

003:005 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they
        set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments.
        And the angel of the LORD stood by.

003:006 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,

003:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways,
        and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my
        house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee
        places to walk among these that stand by.

003:008 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that
        sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I
        will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.

003:009 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one
        stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving
        thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the
        iniquity of that land in one day.

003:010 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man
        his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.

004:001 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as
        a man that is wakened out of his sleep.

004:002 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked,
        and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top
        of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the
        seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:

004:003 And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the
        bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.

004:004 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me,
        saying, What are these, my lord?

004:005 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me,
        Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.

004:006 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word
        of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by
        power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.

004:007 Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt
        become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof
        with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.

004:008 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

004:009 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this
        house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know
        that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.

004:010 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall
        rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel
        with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to
        and fro through the whole earth.

004:011 Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive
        trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left
        side thereof?

004:012 And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two
        olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the
        golden oil out of themselves?

004:013 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be?
        And I said, No, my lord.

004:014 Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by
        the LORD of the whole earth.

005:001 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold
        a flying roll.

005:002 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a
        flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the
        breadth thereof ten cubits.

005:003 Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over
        the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall
        be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that
        sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.

005:004 I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall
        enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him
        that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the
        midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber
        thereof and the stones thereof.

005:005 Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto
        me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth
        forth.

005:006 And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that
        goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance
        through all the earth.

005:007 And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is
        a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.

005:008 And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst
        of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth
        thereof.

005:009 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there
        came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they
        had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the
        ephah between the earth and the heaven.

005:010 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these
        bear the ephah?

005:011 And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of
        Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her
        own base.

006:001 And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and,
        behold, there came four chariots out from between two
        mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.

006:002 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second
        chariot black horses;

006:003 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth
        chariot grisled and bay horses.

006:004 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me,
        What are these, my lord?

006:005 And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four
        spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before
        the LORD of all the earth.

006:006 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north
        country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go
        forth toward the south country.

006:007 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk
        to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk
        to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro
        through the earth.

006:008 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold,
        these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit
        in the north country.

006:009 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

006:010 Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and
        of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the
        same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of
        Zephaniah;

006:011 Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon
        the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;

006:012 And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts,
        saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall
        grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the
        LORD:

006:013 Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear
        the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he
        shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace
        shall be between them both.

006:014 And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to
        Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in
        the temple of the LORD.

006:015 And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple
        of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath
        sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will
        diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.

007:001 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that
        the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of
        the ninth month, even in Chisleu;

007:002 When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and
        Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,

007:003 And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the
        LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in
        the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so
        many years?

007:004 Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,

007:005 Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests,
        saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh
        month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me,
        even to me?

007:006 And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for
        yourselves, and drink for yourselves?

007:007 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the
        former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in
        prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men
        inhabited the south and the plain?

007:008 And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,

007:009 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true
        judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his
        brother:

007:010 And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger,
        nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his
        brother in your heart.

007:011 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and
        stopped their ears, that they should not hear.

007:012 Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they
        should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts
        hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came
        a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.

007:013 Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would
        not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD
        of hosts:

007:014 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations
        whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them,
        that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the
        pleasant land desolate.

008:001 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,

008:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with
        great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.

008:003 Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell
        in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a
        city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy
        mountain.

008:004 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old
        women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with
        his staff in his hand for very age.

008:005 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
        playing in the streets thereof.

008:006 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes
        of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be
        marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.

008:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people
        from the east country, and from the west country;

008:008 And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of
        Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their
        God, in truth and in righteousness.

008:009 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye
        that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the
        prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the
        house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be
        built.

008:010 For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire
        for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or
        came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one
        against his neighbour.

008:011 But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in
        the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.

008:012 For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her
        fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens
        shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this
        people to possess all these things.

008:013 And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the
        heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save
        you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands
        be strong.

008:014 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you,
        when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of
        hosts, and I repented not:

008:015 So again have I thought in these days to do well unto
        Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.

008:016 These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the
        truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and
        peace in your gates:

008:017 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his
        neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things
        that I hate, saith the LORD.

008:018 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,

008:019 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month,
        and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and
        the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and
        gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and
        peace.

008:020 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that
        there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:

008:021 And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying,
        Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the
        LORD of hosts: I will go also.

008:022 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the
        LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.

008:023 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to
        pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the
        nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a
        Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God
        is with you.

009:001 The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and
        Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as
        of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.

009:002 And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though
        it be very wise.

009:003 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up
        silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.

009:004 Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her
        power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.

009:005 Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and
        be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be
        ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon
        shall not be inhabited.

009:006 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the
        pride of the Philistines.

009:007 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his
        abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth,
        even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor
        in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.

009:008 And I will encamp about mine house because of the army,
        because of him that passeth by, and because of him that
        returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more:
        for now have I seen with mine eyes.

009:009 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of
        Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and
        having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a
        colt the foal of an ass.

009:010 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse
        from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he
        shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be
        from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of
        the earth.

009:011 As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent
        forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.

009:012 Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day
        do I declare that I will render double unto thee;

009:013 When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim,
        and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece,
        and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.

009:014 And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go
        forth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the
        trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.

009:015 The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour,
        and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a
        noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls,
        and as the corners of the altar.

009:016 And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the
        flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a
        crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.

009:017 For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty!
        corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the
        maids.

010:001 Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the
        LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain,
        to every one grass in the field.

010:002 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a
        lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain:
        therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled,
        because there was no shepherd.

010:003 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished
        the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the
        house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the
        battle.

010:004 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of
        him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.

010:005 And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their
        enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they
        shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on
        horses shall be confounded.

010:006 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the
        house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them;
        for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had
        not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear
        them.

010:007 And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their
        heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall
        see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.

010:008 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed
        them: and they shall increase as they have increased.

010:009 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember
        me in far countries; and they shall live with their children,
        and turn again.

010:010 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and
        gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the
        land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for
        them.

010:011 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall
        smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river
        shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down,
        and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.

010:012 And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up
        and down in his name, saith the LORD.

011:001 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy
        cedars.

011:002 Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty
        are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the
        vintage is come down.

011:003 There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their
        glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for
        the pride of Jordan is spoiled.

011:004 Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;

011:005 Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty:
        and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am
        rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.

011:006 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the
        LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his
        neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they
        shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver
        them.

011:007 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of
        the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called
        Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.

011:008 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul
        lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.

011:009 Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die;
        and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the
        rest eat every one the flesh of another.

011:010 And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I
        might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.

011:011 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock
        that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.

011:012 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and
        if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of
        silver.

011:013 And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly
        price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty
        pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of
        the LORD.

011:014 Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might
        break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

011:015 And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments
        of a foolish shepherd.

011:016 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall
        not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young
        one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth
        still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their
        claws in pieces.

011:017 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword
        shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall
        be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly
        darkened.

012:001 The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD,
        which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation
        of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.

012:002 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the
        people round about, when they shall be in the siege both
        against Judah and against Jerusalem.

012:003 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for
        all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in
        pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered
        together against it.

012:004 In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with
        astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine
        eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of
        the people with blindness.

012:005 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The
        inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of
        hosts their God.

012:006 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth
        of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf;
        and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right
        hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again
        in her own place, even in Jerusalem.

012:007 The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the
        glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.

012:008 In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of
        Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall
        be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the
        angel of the LORD before them.

012:009 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to
        destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

012:010 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
        inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of
        supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have
        pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his
        only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is
        in bitterness for his firstborn.

012:011 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as
        the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.

012:012 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of
        the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of
        the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;

012:013 The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart;
        the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;

012:014 All the families that remain, every family apart, and their
        wives apart.

013:001 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of
        David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for
        uncleanness.

013:002 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of
        hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the
        land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will
        cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the
        land.

013:003 And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy,
        then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto
        him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name
        of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him
        shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.

013:004 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall
        be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied;
        neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:

013:005 But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man
        taught me to keep cattle from my youth.

013:006 And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine
        hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in
        the house of my friends.

013:007 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that
        is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and
        the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon
        the little ones.

013:008 And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the
        LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the
        third shall be left therein.

013:009 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will
        refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is
        tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I
        will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my
        God.

014:001 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be
        divided in the midst of thee.

014:002 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and
        the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women
        ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity,
        and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the
        city.

014:003 Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations,
        as when he fought in the day of battle.

014:004 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,
        which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives
        shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward
        the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of
        the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it
        toward the south.

014:005 And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the
        valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall
        flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days
        of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and
        all the saints with thee.

014:006 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall
        not be clear, nor dark:

014:007 But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not
        day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening
        time it shall be light.

014:008 And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out
        from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half
        of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall
        it be.

014:009 And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day
        shall there be one LORD, and his name one.

014:010 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon
        south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited
        in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first
        gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel
        unto the king's winepresses.

014:011 And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter
        destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.

014:012 And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all
        the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh
        shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their
        eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall
        consume away in their mouth.

014:013 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult
        from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold
        every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall
        rise up against the hand of his neighbour.

014:014 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all
        the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and
        silver, and apparel, in great abundance.

014:015 And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the
        camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in
        these tents, as this plague.

014:016 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all
        the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from
        year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to
        keep the feast of tabernacles.

014:017 And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the
        families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the
        LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.

014:018 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have
        no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will
        smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of
        tabernacles.

014:019 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of
        all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

014:020 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,
        HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD's house shall
        be like the bowls before the altar.

014:021 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness
        unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come
        and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there
        shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of
        hosts.

Book 39	Malachi

001:001 The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.

001:002 I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast
        thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD:
        yet I loved Jacob,

001:003 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage
        waste for the dragons of the wilderness.

001:004 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return
        and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts,
        They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call
        them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom
        the LORD hath indignation for ever.

001:005 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be
        magnified from the border of Israel.

001:006 A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then
        I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master,
        where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests,
        that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy
        name?

001:007 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein
        have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD
        is contemptible.

001:008 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and
        if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now
        unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy
        person? saith the LORD of hosts.

001:009 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto
        us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons?
        saith the LORD of hosts.

001:010 Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for
        nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I
        have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will
        I accept an offering at your hand.

001:011 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the
        same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every
        place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure
        offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith
        the LORD of hosts.

001:012 But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD
        is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is
        contemptible.

001:013 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have
        snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that
        which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an
        offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.

001:014 But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male,
        and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for
        I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is
        dreadful among the heathen.

002:001 And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.

002:002 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to
        give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even
        send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I
        have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.

002:003 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your
        faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take
        you away with it.

002:004 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you,
        that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.

002:005 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to
        him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before
        my name.

002:006 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found
        in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did
        turn many away from iniquity.

002:007 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should
        seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD
        of hosts.

002:008 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to
        stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi,
        saith the LORD of hosts.

002:009 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before
        all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but
        have been partial in the law.

002:010 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why
        do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by
        profaning the covenant of our fathers?

002:011 Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is
        committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned
        the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the
        daughter of a strange god.

002:012 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and
        the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that
        offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.

002:013 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD
        with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that
        he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with
        good will at your hand.

002:014 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness
        between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast
        dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of
        thy covenant.

002:015 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.
        And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore
        take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously
        against the wife of his youth.

002:016 For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting
        away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the
        LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye
        deal not treacherously.

002:017 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein
        have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is
        good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or,
        Where is the God of judgment?

003:001 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way
        before me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to
        his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye
        delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.

003:002 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand
        when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like
        fullers' soap:

003:003 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he
        shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and
        silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in
        righteousness.

003:004 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant
        unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.

003:005 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
        witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and
        against false swearers, and against those that oppress the
        hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that
        turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith
        the LORD of hosts.

003:006 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob
        are not consumed.

003:007 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine
        ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will
        return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein
        shall we return?

003:008 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein
        have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.

003:009 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this
        whole nation.

003:010 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be
        meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD
        of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and
        pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough
        to receive it.

003:011 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall
        not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine
        cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of
        hosts.

003:012 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a
        delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.

003:013 Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye
        say, What have we spoken so much against thee?

003:014 Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it
        that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked
        mournfully before the LORD of hosts?

003:015 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work
        wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even
        delivered.

003:016 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and
        the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance
        was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that
        thought upon his name.

003:017 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day
        when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man
        spareth his own son that serveth him.

003:018 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and
        the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth
        him not.

004:001 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and
        all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be
        stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the
        LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor
        branch.

004:002 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness
        arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and
        grow up as calves of the stall.

004:003 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes
        under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this,
        saith the LORD of hosts.

004:004 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded
        unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and
        judgments.

004:005 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming
        of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:

004:006 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
        and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come
        and smite the earth with a curse.

Book 40	Matthew

001:001 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
        the son of Abraham.

001:002 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat
        Judas and his brethren;

001:003 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat
        Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;

001:004 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and
        Naasson begat Salmon;

001:005 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth;
        and Obed begat Jesse;

001:006 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat
        Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;

001:007 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia
        begat Asa;

001:008 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram
        begat Ozias;

001:009 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz
        begat Ezekias;

001:010 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon
        begat Josias;

001:011 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time
        they were carried away to Babylon:

001:012 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat
        Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;

001:013 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and
        Eliakim begat Azor;

001:014 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat
        Eliud;

001:015 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and
        Matthan begat Jacob;

001:016 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born
        Jesus, who is called Christ.

001:017 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
        generations; and from David until the carrying away into
        Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away
        into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.

001:018 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
        mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together,
        she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

001:019 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
        make her a publick example, was minded to put her away
        privily.

001:020 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the
        LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
        David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
        which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

001:021 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
        JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

001:022 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
        spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

001:023 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a
        son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being
        interpreted is, God with us.

001:024 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the
        Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:

001:025 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son:
        and he called his name JESUS.

002:001 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
        Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
        Jerusalem,

002:002 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have
        seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

002:003 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled,
        and all Jerusalem with him.

002:004 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of
        the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should
        be born.

002:005 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is
        written by the prophet,

002:006 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least
        among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a
        Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.

002:007 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired
        of them diligently what time the star appeared.

002:008 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search
        diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him,
        bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.

002:009 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the
        star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it
        came and stood over where the young child was.

002:010 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
        joy.

002:011 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young
        child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him:
        and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto
        him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.

002:012 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return
        to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

002:013 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
        appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the
        young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou
        there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young
        child to destroy him.

002:014 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by
        night, and departed into Egypt:

002:015 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be
        fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
        Out of Egypt have I called my son.

002:016 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,
        was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children
        that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from
        two years old and under, according to the time which he had
        diligently enquired of the wise men.

002:017 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
        prophet, saying,

002:018 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and
        great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not
        be comforted, because they are not.

002:019 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord
        appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

002:020 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go
        into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the
        young child's life.

002:021 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and
        came into the land of Israel.

002:022 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the
        room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither:
        notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned
        aside into the parts of Galilee:

002:023 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might
        be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be
        called a Nazarene.

003:001 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the
        wilderness of Judaea,

003:002 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

003:003 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias,
        saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye
        the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

003:004 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a
        leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and
        wild honey.

003:005 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the
        region round about Jordan,

003:006 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.

003:007 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
        his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who
        hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:

003:009 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our
        father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones
        to raise up children unto Abraham.

003:010 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
        therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is
        hewn down, and cast into the fire.

003:011 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that
        cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not
        worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and
        with fire:

003:012 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
        floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn
        up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

003:013 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
        baptized of him.

003:014 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of
        thee, and comest thou to me?

003:015 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for
        thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
        suffered him.

003:016 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of
        the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he
        saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting
        upon him:

003:017 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in
        whom I am well pleased.

004:001 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be
        tempted of the devil.

004:002 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
        afterward an hungred.

004:003 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son
        of God, command that these stones be made bread.

004:004 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
        bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
        mouth of God.

004:005 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth
        him on a pinnacle of the temple,

004:006 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself
        down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
        concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up,
        lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

004:007 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt
        the Lord thy God.

004:008 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high
        mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and
        the glory of them;

004:009 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou
        wilt fall down and worship me.

004:010 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
        written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
        shalt thou serve.

004:011 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and
        ministered unto him.

004:012 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he
        departed into Galilee;

004:013 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is
        upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:

004:014 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
        prophet, saying,

004:015 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of
        the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;

004:016 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them
        which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung
        up.

004:017 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for
        the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

004:018 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren,
        Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into
        the sea: for they were fishers.

004:019 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers
        of men.

004:020 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.

004:021 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the
        son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee
        their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

004:022 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and
        followed him.

004:023 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their
        synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
        healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among
        the people.

004:024 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto
        him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and
        torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and
        those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and
        he healed them.

004:025 And there followed him great multitudes of people from
        Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from
        Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.

005:001 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and
        when he was set, his disciples came unto him:

005:002 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,

005:003 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of
        heaven.

005:004 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.

005:005 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

005:006 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
        righteousness: for they shall be filled.

005:007 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

005:008 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.

005:009 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the
        children of God.

005:010 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake:
        for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

005:011 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,
        and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my
        sake.

005:012 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
        heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before
        you.

005:013 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
        savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good
        for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot
        of men.

005:014 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
        cannot be hid.

005:015 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but
        on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the
        house.

005:016 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
        good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

005:017 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
        I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

005:018 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot
        or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
        fulfilled.

005:019 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least
        commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the
        least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and
        teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
        heaven.

005:020 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall
        exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye
        shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

005:021 Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt
        not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the
        judgment:

005:022 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
        without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and
        whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger
        of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be
        in danger of hell fire.

005:023 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there
        rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;

005:024 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first
        be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
        gift.

005:025 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way
        with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the
        judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be
        cast into prison.

005:026 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out
        thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.

005:027 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt
        not commit adultery:

005:028 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust
        after her hath committed adultery with her already in his
        heart.

005:029 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it
        from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
        members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be
        cast into hell.

005:030 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it
        from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
        members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be
        cast into hell.

005:031 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him
        give her a writing of divorcement:

005:032 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife,
        saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit
        adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced
        committeth adultery.

005:033 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old
        time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto
        the Lord thine oaths:

005:034 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for
        it is God's throne:

005:035 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by
        Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.

005:036 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not
        make one hair white or black.

005:037 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for
        whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.

005:038 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
        tooth for a tooth:

005:039 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever
        shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
        also.

005:040 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy
        coat, let him have thy cloak also.

005:041 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him
        twain.

005:042 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow
        of thee turn not thou away.

005:043 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
        neighbour, and hate thine enemy.

005:044 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
        you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
        despitefully use you, and persecute you;

005:045 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:
        for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
        sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

005:046 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do
        not even the publicans the same?

005:047 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than
        others? do not even the publicans so?

005:048 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
        heaven is perfect.

006:001 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of
        them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in
        heaven.

006:002 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet
        before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
        streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto
        you, They have their reward.

006:003 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
        right hand doeth:

006:004 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth
        in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

006:005 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
        are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in
        the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.
        Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

006:006 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
        thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in
        secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee
        openly.

006:007 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do:
        for they think that they shall be heard for their much
        speaking.

006:008 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth
        what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

006:009 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
        heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

006:010 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in
        heaven.

006:011 Give us this day our daily bread.

006:012 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

006:013 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For
        thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.
        Amen.

006:014 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
        will also forgive you:

006:015 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
        Father forgive your trespasses.

006:016 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
        countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may
        appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have
        their reward.

006:017 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
        face;

006:018 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
        which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret,
        shall reward thee openly.

006:019 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
        rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

006:020 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
        moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break
        through nor steal:

006:021 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

006:022 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be
        single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

006:023 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
        darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness,
        how great is that darkness!

006:024 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
        and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
        despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

006:025 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what
        ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
        what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the
        body than raiment?

006:026 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they
        reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
        them. Are ye not much better than they?

006:027 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his
        stature?

006:028 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of
        the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:

006:029 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was
        not arrayed like one of these.

006:030 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to
        day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much
        more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

006:031 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What
        shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

006:032 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
        heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

006:033 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
        and all these things shall be added unto you.

006:034 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
        take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day
        is the evil thereof.

007:001 Judge not, that ye be not judged.

007:002 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with
        what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

007:003 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
        but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

007:004 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote
        out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

007:005 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye;
        and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of
        thy brother's eye.

007:006 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye
        your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their
        feet, and turn again and rend you.

007:007 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;
        knock, and it shall be opened unto you:

007:008 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
        findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

007:009 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will
        he give him a stone?

007:010 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

007:011 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
        children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven
        give good things to them that ask him?

007:012 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to
        you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the
        prophets.

007:013 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and
        broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there
        be which go in thereat:

007:014 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
        leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

007:015 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's
        clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

007:016 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of
        thorns, or figs of thistles?

007:017 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a
        corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

007:018 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a
        corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

007:019 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
        and cast into the fire.

007:020 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

007:021 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
        the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
        which is in heaven.

007:022 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
        prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils?
        and in thy name done many wonderful works?

007:023 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart
        from me, ye that work iniquity.

007:024 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
        them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house
        upon a rock:

007:025 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
        blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was
        founded upon a rock.

007:026 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
        them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his
        house upon the sand:

007:027 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
        blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the
        fall of it.

007:028 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
        people were astonished at his doctrine:

007:029 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the
        scribes.

008:001 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes
        followed him.

008:002 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying,
        Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

008:003 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will;
        be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

008:004 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy
        way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses
        commanded, for a testimony unto them.

008:005 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him
        a centurion, beseeching him,

008:006 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,
        grievously tormented.

008:007 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.

008:008 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that
        thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only,
        and my servant shall be healed.

008:009 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and
        I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and
        he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

008:010 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that
        followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great
        faith, no, not in Israel.

008:011 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and
        west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
        in the kingdom of heaven.

008:012 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
        darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

008:013 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou
        hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was
        healed in the selfsame hour.

008:014 And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's
        mother laid, and sick of a fever.

008:015 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she
        arose, and ministered unto them.

008:016 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were
        possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his
        word, and healed all that were sick:

008:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
        prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our
        sicknesses.

008:018 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave
        commandment to depart unto the other side.

008:019 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will
        follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

008:020 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds
        of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to
        lay his head.

008:021 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me
        first to go and bury my father.

008:022 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury
        their dead.

008:023 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed
        him.

008:024 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch
        that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.

008:025 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord,
        save us: we perish.

008:026 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little
        faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and
        there was a great calm.

008:027 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this,
        that even the winds and the sea obey him!

008:028 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the
        Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming
        out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass
        by that way.

008:029 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with
        thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment
        us before the time?

008:030 And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine
        feeding.

008:031 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out,
        suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.

008:032 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they
        went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of
        swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and
        perished in the waters.

008:033 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the
        city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the
        possessed of the devils.

008:034 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when
        they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of
        their coasts.

009:001 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his
        own city.

009:002 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy,
        lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the
        sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven
        thee.

009:003 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves,
        This man blasphemeth.

009:004 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil
        in your hearts?

009:005 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or
        to say, Arise, and walk?

009:006 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
        to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,)
        Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.

009:007 And he arose, and departed to his house.

009:008 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified
        God, which had given such power unto men.

009:009 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
        Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto
        him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.

009:010 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house,
        behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him
        and his disciples.

009:011 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples,
        Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?

009:012 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be
        whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.

009:013 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and
        not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but
        sinners to repentance.

009:014 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and
        the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?

009:015 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber
        mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days
        will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and
        then shall they fast.

009:016 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for
        that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment,
        and the rent is made worse.

009:017 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles
        break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but
        they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

009:018 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a
        certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even
        now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall
        live.

009:019 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.

009:020 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of
        blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of
        his garment:

009:021 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I
        shall be whole.

009:022 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
        Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.
        And the woman was made whole from that hour.

009:023 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the
        minstrels and the people making a noise,

009:024 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but
        sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.

009:025 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her
        by the hand, and the maid arose.

009:026 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.

009:027 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
        crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.

009:028 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to
        him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to
        do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.

009:029 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be
        it unto you.

009:030 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,
        saying, See that no man know it.

009:031 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in
        all that country.

009:032 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man
        possessed with a devil.

009:033 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the
        multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.

009:034 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the
        prince of the devils.

009:035 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in
        their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
        healing every sickness and every disease among the people.

009:036 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion
        on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as
        sheep having no shepherd.

009:037 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is
        plenteous, but the labourers are few;

009:038 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send
        forth labourers into his harvest.

010:001 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave
        them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to
        heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

010:002 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first,
        Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the
        son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

010:003 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican;
        James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was
        Thaddaeus;

010:004 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
        him.

010:005 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go
        not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the
        Samaritans enter ye not:

010:006 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

010:007 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at
        hand.

010:008 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
        devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

010:009 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,

010:010 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes,
        nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.

010:011 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who
        in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

010:012 And when ye come into an house, salute it.

010:013 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but
        if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

010:014 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when
        ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of
        your feet.

010:015 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land
        of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that
        city.

010:016 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be
        ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

010:017 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the
        councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;

010:018 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my
        sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.

010:019 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
        shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what
        ye shall speak.

010:020 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father
        which speaketh in you.

010:021 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the
        father the child: and the children shall rise up against their
        parents, and cause them to be put to death.

010:022 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he
        that endureth to the end shall be saved.

010:023 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into
        another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone
        over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.

010:024 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above
        his lord.

010:025 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and
        the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the
        house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his
        household?

010:026 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that
        shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.

010:027 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what
        ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.

010:028 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to
        kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy
        both soul and body in hell.

010:029 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them
        shall not fall on the ground without your Father.

010:030 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

010:031 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many
        sparrows.

010:032 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
        confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

010:033 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
        before my Father which is in heaven.

010:034 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to
        send peace, but a sword.

010:035 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and
        the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law
        against her mother in law.

010:036 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

010:037 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of
        me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not
        worthy of me.

010:038 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is
        not worthy of me.

010:039 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his
        life for my sake shall find it.

010:040 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
        receiveth him that sent me.

010:041 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
        receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous
        man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous
        man's reward.

010:042 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little
        ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple,
        verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

011:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding
        his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to
        preach in their cities.

011:002 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he
        sent two of his disciples,

011:003 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look
        for another?

011:004 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again
        those things which ye do hear and see:

011:005 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers
        are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and
        the poor have the gospel preached to them.

011:006 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

011:007 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
        concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?
        A reed shaken with the wind?

011:008 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
        raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings'
        houses.

011:009 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto
        you, and more than a prophet.

011:010 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
        messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before
        thee.

011:011 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there
        hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist:
        notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is
        greater than he.

011:012 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
        heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.

011:013 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

011:014 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to
        come.

011:015 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

011:016 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto
        children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their
        fellows,

011:017 And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we
        have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.

011:018 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He
        hath a devil.

011:019 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold
        a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and
        sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.

011:020 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
        works were done, because they repented not:

011:021 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
        mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre
        and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and
        ashes.

011:022 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
        Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.

011:023 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
        brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been
        done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained
        until this day.

011:024 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the
        land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

011:025 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
        Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things
        from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.

011:026 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.

011:027 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
        knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
        Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
        him.

011:028 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
        will give you rest.

011:029 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
        lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

011:030 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

012:001 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn;
        and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears
        of corn and to eat.

012:002 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy
        disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath
        day.

012:003 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when
        he was an hungred, and they that were with him;

012:004 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the
        shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for
        them which were with him, but only for the priests?

012:005 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days
        the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are
        blameless?

012:006 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the
        temple.

012:007 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and
        not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.

012:008 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.

012:009 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:

012:010 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And
        they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath
        days? that they might accuse him.

012:011 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that
        shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath
        day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?

012:012 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is
        lawful to do well on the sabbath days.

012:013 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
        stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the
        other.

012:014 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him,
        how they might destroy him.

012:015 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and
        great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;

012:016 And charged them that they should not make him known:

012:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
        prophet, saying,

012:018 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my
        soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he
        shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.

012:019 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his
        voice in the streets.

012:020 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he
        not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.

012:021 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.

012:022 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind,
        and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb
        both spake and saw.

012:023 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son
        of David?

012:024 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth
        not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the
        devils.

012:025 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every
        kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and
        every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:

012:026 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself;
        how shall then his kingdom stand?

012:027 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your
        children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.

012:028 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the
        kingdom of God is come unto you.

012:029 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil
        his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he
        will spoil his house.

012:030 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth
        not with me scattereth abroad.

012:031 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy
        shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy
        Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.

012:032 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall
        be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy
        Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world,
        neither in the world to come.

012:033 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make
        the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known
        by his fruit.

012:034 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
        things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
        speaketh.

012:035 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth
        forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure
        bringeth forth evil things.

012:036 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
        they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.

012:037 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
        thou shalt be condemned.

012:038 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
        saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.

012:039 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
        generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be
        given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:

012:040 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's
        belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights
        in the heart of the earth.

012:041 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this
        generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the
        preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

012:042 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
        generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the
        uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
        and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

012:043 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
        through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.

012:044 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
        out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and
        garnished.

012:045 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits
        more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there:
        and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even
        so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.

012:046 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his
        brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.

012:047 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
        stand without, desiring to speak with thee.

012:048 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my
        mother? and who are my brethren?

012:049 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and
        said, Behold my mother and my brethren!

012:050 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in
        heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

013:001 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea
        side.

013:002 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that
        he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on
        the shore.

013:003 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying,
        Behold, a sower went forth to sow;

013:004 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the
        fowls came and devoured them up:

013:005 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth:
        and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of
        earth:

013:006 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they
        had no root, they withered away.

013:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and
        choked them:

013:008 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some
        an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.

013:009 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

013:010 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou
        unto them in parables?

013:011 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you
        to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
        is not given.

013:012 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
        more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be
        taken away even that he hath.

013:013 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see
        not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

013:014 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith,
        By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing
        ye shall see, and shall not perceive:

013:015 For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are
        dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any
        time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears,
        and should understand with their heart, and should be
        converted, and I should heal them.

013:016 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for
        they hear.

013:017 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous
        men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have
        not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and
        have not heard them.

013:018 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.

013:019 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and
        understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth
        away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which
        received seed by the way side.

013:020 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is
        he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;

013:021 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for
        when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word,
        by and by he is offended.

013:022 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth
        the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of
        riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.

013:023 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that
        heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth
        fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty,
        some thirty.

013:024 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
        heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his
        field:

013:025 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the
        wheat, and went his way.

013:026 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit,
        then appeared the tares also.

013:027 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him,
        Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence
        then hath it tares?

013:028 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said
        unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

013:029 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root
        up also the wheat with them.

013:030 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of
        harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first
        the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather
        the wheat into my barn.

013:031 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
        heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took,
        and sowed in his field:

013:032 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown,
        it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that
        the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.

013:033 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is
        like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three
        measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

013:034 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables;
        and without a parable spake he not unto them:

013:035 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
        saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things
        which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.

013:036 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house:
        and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the
        parable of the tares of the field.

013:037 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed
        is the Son of man;

013:038 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the
        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;

013:039 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end
        of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

013:040 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so
        shall it be in the end of this world.

013:041 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
        gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them
        which do iniquity;

013:042 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be
        wailing and gnashing of teeth.

013:043 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
        of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

013:044 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
        field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy
        thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that
        field.

013:045 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
        seeking goodly pearls:

013:046 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold
        all that he had, and bought it.

013:047 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
        into the sea, and gathered of every kind:

013:048 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and
        gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

013:049 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
        forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,

013:050 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be
        wailing and gnashing of teeth.

013:051 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
        They say unto him, Yea, Lord.

013:052 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is
        instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that
        is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure
        things new and old.

013:053 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
        parables, he departed thence.

013:054 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in
        their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said,
        Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?

013:055 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called
        Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and
        Judas?

013:056 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath
        this man all these things?

013:057 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A
        prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in
        his own house.

013:058 And he did not many mighty works there because of their
        unbelief.

014:001 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,

014:002 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is
        risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth
        themselves in him.

014:003 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in
        prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.

014:004 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

014:005 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the
        multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.

014:006 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias
        danced before them, and pleased Herod.

014:007 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
        would ask.

014:008 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me
        here John Baptist's head in a charger.

014:009 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and
        them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given
        her.

014:010 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.

014:011 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the
        damsel: and she brought it to her mother.

014:012 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it,
        and went and told Jesus.

014:013 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a
        desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof,
        they followed him on foot out of the cities.

014:014 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved
        with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.

014:015 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying,
        This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the
        multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy
        themselves victuals.

014:016 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them
        to eat.

014:017 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two
        fishes.

014:018 He said, Bring them hither to me.

014:019 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and
        took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to
        heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his
        disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

014:020 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
        fragments that remained twelve baskets full.

014:021 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside
        women and children.

014:022 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a
        ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent
        the multitudes away.

014:023 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a
        mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was
        there alone.

014:024 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with
        waves: for the wind was contrary.

014:025 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,
        walking on the sea.

014:026 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
        troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.

014:027 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good
        cheer; it is I; be not afraid.

014:028 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
        come unto thee on the water.

014:029 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the
        ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.

014:030 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
        beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.

014:031 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught
        him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore
        didst thou doubt?

014:032 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.

014:033 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him,
        saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

014:034 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of
        Gennesaret.

014:035 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent
        out into all that country round about, and brought unto him
        all that were diseased;

014:036 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his
        garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.

015:001 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of
        Jerusalem, saying,

015:002 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?
        for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.

015:003 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress
        the commandment of God by your tradition?

015:004 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and,
        He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.

015:005 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
        It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;

015:006 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.
        Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by
        your tradition.

015:007 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,

015:008 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and
        honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.

015:009 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
        commandments of men.

015:010 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
        understand:

015:011 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that
        which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

015:012 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
        the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?

015:013 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly
        Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.

015:014 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
        blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

015:015 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
        parable.

015:016 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?

015:017 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the
        mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?

015:018 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth
        from the heart; and they defile the man.

015:019 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders,
        adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:

015:020 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with
        unwashen hands defileth not a man.

015:021 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre
        and Sidon.

015:022 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,
        and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son
        of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

015:023 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
        besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

015:024 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost
        sheep of the house of Israel.

015:025 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

015:026 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the
        children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.

015:027 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
        which fall from their masters' table.

015:028 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy
        faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was
        made whole from that very hour.

015:029 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
        Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.

015:030 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those
        that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast
        them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:

015:031 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb
        to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the
        blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.

015:032 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have
        compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now
        three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them
        away fasting, lest they faint in the way.

015:033 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much
        bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?

015:034 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they
        said, Seven, and a few little fishes.

015:035 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.

015:036 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,
        and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples
        to the multitude.

015:037 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
        broken meat that was left seven baskets full.

015:038 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and
        children.

015:039 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into
        the coasts of Magdala.

016:001 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting
        desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.

016:002 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It
        will be fair weather: for the sky is red.

016:003 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the
        sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the
        face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the
        times?

016:004 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and
        there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the
        prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.

016:005 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
        forgotten to take bread.

016:006 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven
        of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

016:007 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we
        have taken no bread.

016:008 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little
        faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought
        no bread?

016:009 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of
        the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

016:010 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many
        baskets ye took up?

016:011 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you
        concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the
        Pharisees and of the Sadducees?

016:012 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the
        leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of
        the Sadducees.

016:013 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
        his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man
        am?

016:014 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,
        Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

016:015 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?

016:016 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the
        Son of the living God.

016:017 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
        Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
        but my Father which is in heaven.

016:018 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
        rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not
        prevail against it.

016:019 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven:
        and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
        heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
        loosed in heaven.

016:020 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man
        that he was Jesus the Christ.

016:021 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples,
        how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of
        the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and
        be raised again the third day.

016:022 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it
        far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.

016:023 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
        thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things
        that be of God, but those that be of men.

016:024 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after
        me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow
        me.

016:025 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever
        will lose his life for my sake shall find it.

016:026 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
        and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange
        for his soul?

016:027 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with
        his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to
        his works.

016:028 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which
        shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming
        in his kingdom.

017:001 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
        brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,

017:002 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as
        the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.

017:003 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
        with him.

017:004 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for
        us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three
        tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
        Elias.

017:005 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them:
        and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my
        beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

017:006 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and
        were sore afraid.

017:007 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
        afraid.

017:008 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save
        Jesus only.

017:009 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
        saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be
        risen again from the dead.

017:010 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes
        that Elias must first come?

017:011 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first
        come, and restore all things.

017:012 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew
        him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed.
        Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.

017:013 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John
        the Baptist.

017:014 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a
        certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,

017:015 Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore
        vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the
        water.

017:016 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure
        him.

017:017 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse
        generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I
        suffer you? bring him hither to me.

017:018 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and
        the child was cured from that very hour.

017:019 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could
        not we cast him out?

017:020 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily
        I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed,
        ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place;
        and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

017:021 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

017:022 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son
        of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:

017:023 And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised
        again. And they were exceeding sorry.

017:024 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received
        tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master
        pay tribute?

017:025 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus
        prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do
        the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own
        children, or of strangers?

017:026 Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then
        are the children free.

017:027 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the
        sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh
        up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a
        piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.

018:001 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is
        the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

018:002 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the
        midst of them,

018:003 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and
        become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
        of heaven.

018:004 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
        the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

018:005 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
        receiveth me.

018:006 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe
        in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged
        about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the
        sea.

018:007 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be
        that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence
        cometh!

018:008 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off,
        and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into
        life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet
        to be cast into everlasting fire.

018:009 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
        thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,
        rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.

018:010 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I
        say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the
        face of my Father which is in heaven.

018:011 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

018:012 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them
        be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and
        goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone
        astray?

018:013 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he
        rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine
        which went not astray.

018:014 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
        that one of these little ones should perish.

018:015 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and
        tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall
        hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.

018:016 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
        more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
        may be established.

018:017 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:
        but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as
        an heathen man and a publican.

018:018 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
        be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth
        shall be loosed in heaven.

018:019 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth
        as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done
        for them of my Father which is in heaven.

018:020 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
        am I in the midst of them.

018:021 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my
        brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?

018:022 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times:
        but, Until seventy times seven.

018:023 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain
        king, which would take account of his servants.

018:024 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him,
        which owed him ten thousand talents.

018:025 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to
        be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and
        payment to be made.

018:026 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,
        Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

018:027 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
        loosed him, and forgave him the debt.

018:028 But the same servant went out, and found one of his
        fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid
        hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that
        thou owest.

018:029 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,
        saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

018:030 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he
        should pay the debt.

018:031 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very
        sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.

018:032 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O
        thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because
        thou desiredst me:

018:033 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
        fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?

018:034 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors,
        till he should pay all that was due unto him.

018:035 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye
        from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their
        trespasses.

019:001 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
        sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of
        Judaea beyond Jordan;

019:002 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

019:003 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying
        unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for
        every cause?

019:004 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he
        which made them at the beginning made them male and female,

019:005 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
        and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one
        flesh?

019:006 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What
        therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

019:007 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a
        writing of divorcement, and to put her away?

019:008 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your
        hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the
        beginning it was not so.

019:009 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except
        it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth
        adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit
        adultery.

019:010 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with
        his wife, it is not good to marry.

019:011 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying,
        save they to whom it is given.

019:012 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their
        mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made
        eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made
        themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that
        is able to receive it, let him receive it.

019:013 Then were there brought unto him little children, that he
        should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples
        rebuked them.

019:014 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not,
        to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

019:015 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.

019:016 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what
        good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

019:017 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none
        good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life,
        keep the commandments.

019:018 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
        Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou
        shalt not bear false witness,

019:019 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy
        neighbour as thyself.

019:020 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept
        from my youth up: what lack I yet?

019:021 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that
        thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure
        in heaven: and come and follow me.

019:022 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
        sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

019:023 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you,
        That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

019:024 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go
        through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into
        the kingdom of God.

019:025 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
        saying, Who then can be saved?

019:026 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is
        impossible; but with God all things are possible.

019:027 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have
        forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?

019:028 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which
        have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man
        shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon
        twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

019:029 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
        sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands,
        for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall
        inherit everlasting life.

019:030 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be
        first.

020:001 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
        householder, which went out early in the morning to hire
        labourers into his vineyard.

020:002 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day,
        he sent them into his vineyard.

020:003 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing
        idle in the marketplace,

020:004 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and
        whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.

020:005 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did
        likewise.

020:006 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others
        standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the
        day idle?

020:007 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto
        them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right,
        that shall ye receive.

020:008 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
        steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire,
        beginning from the last unto the first.

020:009 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour,
        they received every man a penny.

020:010 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
        received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.

020:011 And when they had received it, they murmured against the
        goodman of the house,

020:012 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast
        made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat
        of the day.

020:013 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
        wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?

020:014 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this
        last, even as unto thee.

020:015 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
        thine eye evil, because I am good?

020:016 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be
        called, but few chosen.

020:017 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples
        apart in the way, and said unto them,

020:018 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be
        betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they
        shall condemn him to death,

020:019 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge,
        and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.

020:020 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her
        sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.

020:021 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him,
        Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right
        hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.

020:022 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye
        able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be
        baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say
        unto him, We are able.

020:023 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and
        be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to
        sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but
        it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my
        Father.

020:024 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation
        against the two brethren.

020:025 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the
        princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they
        that are great exercise authority upon them.

020:026 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great
        among you, let him be your minister;

020:027 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your
        servant:

020:028 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
        minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

020:029 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed
        him.

020:030 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they
        heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on
        us, O Lord, thou son of David.

020:031 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their
        peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O
        Lord, thou son of David.

020:032 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye
        that I shall do unto you?

020:033 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

020:034 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and
        immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

021:001 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to
        Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two
        disciples,

021:002 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
        straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her:
        loose them, and bring them unto me.

021:003 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath
        need of them; and straightway he will send them.

021:004 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
        by the prophet, saying,

021:005 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto
        thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an
        ass.

021:006 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,

021:007 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their
        clothes, and they set him thereon.

021:008 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;
        others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in
        the way.

021:009 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
        saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh
        in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

021:010 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
        saying, Who is this?

021:011 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth
        of Galilee.

021:012 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
        that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables
        of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,

021:013 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called
        the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.

021:014 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he
        healed them.

021:015 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful
        things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and
        saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore
        displeased,

021:016 And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus
        saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of
        babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?

021:017 And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and
        he lodged there.

021:018 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.

021:019 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and
        found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let
        no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the
        fig tree withered away.

021:020 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How
        soon is the fig tree withered away!

021:021 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If
        ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which
        is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this
        mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it
        shall be done.

021:022 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,
        ye shall receive.

021:023 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and
        the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and
        said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave
        thee this authority?

021:024 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one
        thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by
        what authority I do these things.

021:025 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?
        And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
        From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe
        him?

021:026 But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold
        John as a prophet.

021:027 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said
        unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
        things.

021:028 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to
        the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.

021:029 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented,
        and went.

021:030 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered
        and said, I go, sir: and went not.

021:031 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say
        unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto
        you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of
        God before you.

021:032 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
        believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed
        him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that
        ye might believe him.

021:033 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which
        planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a
        winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to
        husbandmen, and went into a far country:

021:034 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
        to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.

021:035 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed
        another, and stoned another.

021:036 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they
        did unto them likewise.

021:037 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
        reverence my son.

021:038 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among
        themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let
        us seize on his inheritance.

021:039 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and
        slew him.

021:040 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he
        do unto those husbandmen?

021:041 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men,
        and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which
        shall render him the fruits in their seasons.

021:042 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,
        The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the
        head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is
        marvellous in our eyes?

021:043 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken
        from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
        thereof.

021:044 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on
        whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

021:045 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his
        parables, they perceived that he spake of them.

021:046 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
        multitude, because they took him for a prophet.

022:001 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and
        said,

022:002 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made
        a marriage for his son,

022:003 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to
        the wedding: and they would not come.

022:004 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which
        are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my
        fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the
        marriage.

022:005 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his
        farm, another to his merchandise:

022:006 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them
        spitefully, and slew them.

022:007 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent
        forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up
        their city.

022:008 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
        which were bidden were not worthy.

022:009 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall
        find, bid to the marriage.

022:010 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
        together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the
        wedding was furnished with guests.

022:011 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a
        man which had not on a wedding garment:

022:012 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not
        having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

022:013 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot,
        and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there
        shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

022:014 For many are called, but few are chosen.

022:015 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
        entangle him in his talk.

022:016 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
        saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the
        way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou
        regardest not the person of men.

022:017 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
        tribute unto Caesar, or not?

022:018 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye
        me, ye hypocrites?

022:019 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.

022:020 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
        superscription?

022:021 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render
        therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto
        God the things that are God's.

022:022 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,
        and went their way.

022:023 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there
        is no resurrection, and asked him,

022:024 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children,
        his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his
        brother.

022:025 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he
        had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his
        wife unto his brother:

022:026 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.

022:027 And last of all the woman died also.

022:028 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
        seven? for they all had her.

022:029 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the
        scriptures, nor the power of God.

022:030 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
        marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

022:031 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
        that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,

022:032 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
        Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

022:033 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his
        doctrine.

022:034 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
        to silence, they were gathered together.

022:035 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
        tempting him, and saying,

022:036 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

022:037 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
        thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

022:038 This is the first and great commandment.

022:039 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
        as thyself.

022:040 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

022:041 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

022:042 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say
        unto him, The son of David.

022:043 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him
        Lord, saying,

022:044 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I
        make thine enemies thy footstool?

022:045 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?

022:046 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any
        man from that day forth ask him any more questions.

023:001 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,

023:002 Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:

023:003 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe
        and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do
        not.

023:004 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
        them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move
        them with one of their fingers.

023:005 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make
        broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their
        garments,

023:006 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in
        the synagogues,

023:007 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi,
        Rabbi.

023:008 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even
        Christ; and all ye are brethren.

023:009 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your
        Father, which is in heaven.

023:010 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even
        Christ.

023:011 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.

023:012 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that
        shall humble himself shall be exalted.

023:013 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
        shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go
        in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go
        in.

023:014 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour
        widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore
        ye shall receive the greater damnation.

023:015 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
        compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is
        made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than
        yourselves.

023:016 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall
        swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear
        by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!

023:017 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the
        temple that sanctifieth the gold?

023:018 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but
        whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.

023:019 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the
        altar that sanctifieth the gift?

023:020 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and
        by all things thereon.

023:021 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by
        him that dwelleth therein.

023:022 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of
        God, and by him that sitteth thereon.

023:023 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
        tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the
        weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith:
        these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
        undone.

023:024 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.

023:025 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
        clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within
        they are full of extortion and excess.

023:026 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the
        cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.

023:027 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are
        like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful
        outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all
        uncleanness.

023:028 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but
        within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

023:029 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
        build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of
        the righteous,

023:030 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would
        not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
        prophets.

023:031 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the
        children of them which killed the prophets.

023:032 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.

023:033 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the
        damnation of hell?

023:034 Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and
        scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some
        of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute
        them from city to city:

023:035 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the
        earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of
        Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple
        and the altar.

023:036 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
        generation.

023:037 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
        stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have
        gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her
        chickens under her wings, and ye would not!

023:038 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.

023:039 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye
        shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

024:001 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his
        disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the
        temple.

024:002 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily
        I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon
        another, that shall not be thrown down.

024:003 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came
        unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things
        be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end
        of the world?

024:004 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man
        deceive you.

024:005 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
        deceive many.

024:006 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be
        not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the
        end is not yet.

024:007 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
        kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and
        earthquakes, in divers places.

024:008 All these are the beginning of sorrows.

024:009 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill
        you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.

024:010 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another,
        and shall hate one another.

024:011 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.

024:012 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
        cold.

024:013 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be
        saved.

024:014 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
        world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
        come.

024:015 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
        spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place,
        (whoso readeth, let him understand:)

024:016 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:

024:017 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any
        thing out of his house:

024:018 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his
        clothes.

024:019 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
        suck in those days!

024:020 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on
        the sabbath day:

024:021 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the
        beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.

024:022 And except those days should be shortened, there should no
        flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be
        shortened.

024:023 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or
        there; believe it not.

024:024 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and
        shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were
        possible, they shall deceive the very elect.

024:025 Behold, I have told you before.

024:026 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the
        desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers;
        believe it not.

024:027 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even
        unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

024:028 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be
        gathered together.

024:029 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun
        be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the
        stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens
        shall be shaken:

024:030 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven:
        and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they
        shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with
        power and great glory.

024:031 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
        and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds,
        from one end of heaven to the other.

024:032 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
        tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:

024:033 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that
        it is near, even at the doors.

024:034 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till
        all these things be fulfilled.

024:035 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
        away.

024:036 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of
        heaven, but my Father only.

024:037 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the
        Son of man be.

024:038 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
        and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day
        that Noe entered into the ark,

024:039 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so
        shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

024:040 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and
        the other left.

024:041 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be
        taken, and the other left.

024:042 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth
        come.

024:043 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in
        what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and
        would not have suffered his house to be broken up.

024:044 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think
        not the Son of man cometh.

024:045 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath
        made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due
        season?

024:046 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall
        find so doing.

024:047 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all
        his goods.

024:048 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
        delayeth his coming;

024:049 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and
        drink with the drunken;

024:050 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh
        not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,

024:051 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with
        the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

025:001 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,
        which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

025:002 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

025:003 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
        them:

025:004 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

025:005 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

025:006 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
        cometh; go ye out to meet him.

025:007 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

025:008 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for
        our lamps are gone out.

025:009 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not
        enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and
        buy for yourselves.

025:010 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that
        were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was
        shut.

025:011 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
        open to us.

025:012 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you
        not.

025:013 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
        wherein the Son of man cometh.

025:014 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
        country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them
        his goods.

025:015 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
        another one; to every man according to his several ability;
        and straightway took his journey.

025:016 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded
        with the same, and made them other five talents.

025:017 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other
        two.

025:018 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and
        hid his lord's money.

025:019 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
        reckoneth with them.

025:020 And so he that had received five talents came and brought
        other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me
        five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents
        more.

025:021 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
        servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will
        make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of
        thy lord.

025:022 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord,
        thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained
        two other talents beside them.

025:023 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;
        thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee
        ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

025:024 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord,
        I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast
        not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:

025:025 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth:
        lo, there thou hast that is thine.

025:026 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
        servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and
        gather where I have not strawed:

025:027 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the
        exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine
        own with usury.

025:028 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
        hath ten talents.

025:029 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
        abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even
        that which he hath.

025:030 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness:
        there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

025:031 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
        angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his
        glory:

025:032 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
        separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his
        sheep from the goats:

025:033 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on
        the left.

025:034 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
        blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
        from the foundation of the world:

025:035 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and
        ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

025:036 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was
        in prison, and ye came unto me.

025:037 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
        thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee
        drink?

025:038 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and
        clothed thee?

025:039 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

025:040 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto
        you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of
        these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.

025:041 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
        me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
        and his angels:

025:042 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty,
        and ye gave me no drink:

025:043 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed
        me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

025:044 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
        thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick,
        or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?

025:045 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you,
        Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did
        it not to me.

025:046 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
        righteous into life eternal.

026:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these
        sayings, he said unto his disciples,

026:002 Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and
        the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.

026:003 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes,
        and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high
        priest, who was called Caiaphas,

026:004 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill
        him.

026:005 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
        among the people.

026:006 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the
        leper,

026:007 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
        precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at
        meat.

026:008 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying,
        To what purpose is this waste?

026:009 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to
        the poor.

026:010 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye
        the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.

026:011 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not
        always.

026:012 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did
        it for my burial.

026:013 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
        preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this
        woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.

026:014 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the
        chief priests,

026:015 And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver
        him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces
        of silver.

026:016 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

026:017 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the
        disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that
        we prepare for thee to eat the passover?

026:018 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him,
        The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover
        at thy house with my disciples.

026:019 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they
        made ready the passover.

026:020 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

026:021 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one
        of you shall betray me.

026:022 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
        to say unto him, Lord, is it I?

026:023 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in
        the dish, the same shall betray me.

026:024 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto
        that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good
        for that man if he had not been born.

026:025 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is
        it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.

026:026 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
        brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat;
        this is my body.

026:027 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
        saying, Drink ye all of it;

026:028 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for
        many for the remission of sins.

026:029 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit
        of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my
        Father's kingdom.

026:030 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount
        of Olives.

026:031 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because
        of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the
        shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered
        abroad.

026:032 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

026:033 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be
        offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.

026:034 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
        before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

026:035 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
        not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.

026:036 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane,
        and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray
        yonder.

026:037 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
        began to be sorrowful and very heavy.

026:038 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
        unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.

026:039 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and
        prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
        pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

026:040 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and
        saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?

026:041 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit
        indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

026:042 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my
        Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink
        it, thy will be done.

026:043 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were
        heavy.

026:044 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
        time, saying the same words.

026:045 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on
        now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the
        Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

026:046 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray
        me.

026:047 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came,
        and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from
        the chief priests and elders of the people.

026:048 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever
        I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.

026:049 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
        kissed him.

026:050 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
        came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.

026:051 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out
        his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high
        priest's, and smote off his ear.

026:052 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his
        place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the
        sword.

026:053 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he
        shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

026:054 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it
        must be?

026:055 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come
        out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?
        I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no
        hold on me.

026:056 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets
        might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and
        fled.

026:057 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas
        the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were
        assembled.

026:058 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace,
        and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.

026:059 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought
        false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;

026:060 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet
        found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,

026:061 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of
        God, and to build it in three days.

026:062 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
        nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?

026:063 But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and
        said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell
        us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.

026:064 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto
        you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the
        right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

026:065 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
        blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now
        ye have heard his blasphemy.

026:066 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.

026:067 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
        smote him with the palms of their hands,

026:068 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote
        thee?

026:069 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto
        him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.

026:070 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
        sayest.

026:071 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,
        and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with
        Jesus of Nazareth.

026:072 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.

026:073 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said
        to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech
        bewrayeth thee.

026:074 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the
        man. And immediately the cock crew.

026:075 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
        Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went
        out, and wept bitterly.

027:001 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of
        the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:

027:002 And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered
        him to Pontius Pilate the governor.

027:003 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
        condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty
        pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,

027:004 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent
        blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.

027:005 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
        departed, and went and hanged himself.

027:006 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is
        not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is
        the price of blood.

027:007 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's
        field, to bury strangers in.

027:008 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this
        day.

027:009 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
        prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver,
        the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of
        Israel did value;

027:010 And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed
        me.

027:011 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked
        him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said
        unto him, Thou sayest.

027:012 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he
        answered nothing.

027:013 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things
        they witness against thee?

027:014 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the
        governor marvelled greatly.

027:015 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
        people a prisoner, whom they would.

027:016 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

027:017 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto
        them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus
        which is called Christ?

027:018 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.

027:019 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
        him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I
        have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.

027:020 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
        they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

027:021 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain
        will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.

027:022 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which
        is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.

027:023 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they
        cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

027:024 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather
        a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before
        the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just
        person: see ye to it.

027:025 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us,
        and on our children.

027:026 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged
        Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.

027:027 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
        hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.

027:028 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.

027:029 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
        his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the
        knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the
        Jews!

027:030 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on
        the head.

027:031 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off
        from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to
        crucify him.

027:032 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by
        name: him they compelled to bear his cross.

027:033 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is
        to say, a place of a skull,

027:034 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he
        had tasted thereof, he would not drink.

027:035 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:
        that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
        They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did
        they cast lots.

027:036 And sitting down they watched him there;

027:037 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS
        THE KING OF THE JEWS.

027:038 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the
        right hand, and another on the left.

027:039 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,

027:040 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it
        in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come
        down from the cross.

027:041 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
        and elders, said,

027:042 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of
        Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
        believe him.

027:043 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have
        him: for he said, I am the Son of God.

027:044 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same
        in his teeth.

027:045 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
        unto the ninth hour.

027:046 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
        saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my
        God, why hast thou forsaken me?

027:047 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said,
        This man calleth for Elias.

027:048 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled
        it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.

027:049 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
        save him.

027:050 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up
        the ghost.

027:051 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
        top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks
        rent;

027:052 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints
        which slept arose,

027:053 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went
        into the holy city, and appeared unto many.

027:054 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
        Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done,
        they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

027:055 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed
        Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:

027:056 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James
        and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.

027:057 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,
        named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:

027:058 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
        commanded the body to be delivered.

027:059 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
        linen cloth,

027:060 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the
        rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
        sepulchre, and departed.

027:061 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
        against the sepulchre.

027:062 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation,
        the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,

027:063 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was
        yet alive, After three days I will rise again.

027:064 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
        third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him
        away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so
        the last error shall be worse than the first.

027:065 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it
        as sure as ye can.

027:066 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,
        and setting a watch.

028:001 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the
        first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
        to see the sepulchre.

028:002 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of
        the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the
        stone from the door, and sat upon it.

028:003 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
        snow:

028:004 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead
        men.

028:005 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye:
        for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

028:006 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the
        place where the Lord lay.

028:007 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from
        the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there
        shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.

028:008 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and
        great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.

028:009 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met
        them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the
        feet, and worshipped him.

028:010 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren
        that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.

028:011 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into
        the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things
        that were done.

028:012 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
        counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,

028:013 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him
        away while we slept.

028:014 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him,
        and secure you.

028:015 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this
        saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.

028:016 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a
        mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

028:017 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.

028:018 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given
        unto me in heaven and in earth.

028:019 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
        name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

028:020 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
        commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end
        of the world. Amen.

Book 41	Mark

001:001 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;

001:002 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger
        before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

001:003 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
        of the Lord, make his paths straight.

001:004 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
        repentance for the remission of sins.

001:005 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they
        of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of
        Jordan, confessing their sins.

001:006 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a
        skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;

001:007 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after
        me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down
        and unloose.

001:008 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize
        you with the Holy Ghost.

001:009 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from
        Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

001:010 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
        opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:

001:011 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my
        beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

001:012 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.

001:013 And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of
        Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered
        unto him.

001:014 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
        Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,

001:015 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is
        at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.

001:016 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and
        Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were
        fishers.

001:017 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make
        you to become fishers of men.

001:018 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.

001:019 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the
        son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the
        ship mending their nets.

001:020 And straightway he called them: and they left their father
        Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after
        him.

001:021 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath
        day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.

001:022 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them
        as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.

001:023 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;
        and he cried out,

001:024 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus
        of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
        art, the Holy One of God.

001:025 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
        him.

001:026 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a
        loud voice, he came out of him.

001:027 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
        themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is
        this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean
        spirits, and they do obey him.

001:028 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the
        region round about Galilee.

001:029 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they
        entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and
        John.

001:030 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they
        tell him of her.

001:031 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
        immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.

001:032 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all
        that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.

001:033 And all the city was gathered together at the door.

001:034 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast
        out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because
        they knew him.

001:035 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he
        went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there
        prayed.

001:036 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.

001:037 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek
        for thee.

001:038 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I
        may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.

001:039 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee,
        and cast out devils.

001:040 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling
        down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst
        make me clean.

001:041 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and
        touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.

001:042 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed
        from him, and he was cleansed.

001:043 And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;

001:044 And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go
        thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy
        cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony
        unto them.

001:045 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze
        abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly
        enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and
        they came to him from every quarter.

002:001 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it
        was noised that he was in the house.

002:002 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that
        there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about
        the door: and he preached the word unto them.

002:003 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which
        was borne of four.

002:004 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they
        uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it
        up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

002:005 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the
        palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.

002:006 But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and
        reasoning in their hearts,

002:007 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins
        but God only?

002:008 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they
        so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason
        ye these things in your hearts?

002:009 Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins
        be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and
        walk?

002:010 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
        to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)

002:011 I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way
        into thine house.

002:012 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth
        before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and
        glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.

002:013 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude
        resorted unto him, and he taught them.

002:014 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting
        at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he
        arose and followed him.

002:015 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,
        many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and
        his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.

002:016 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans
        and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he
        eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?

002:017 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole
        have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came
        not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

002:018 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast:
        and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John
        and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?

002:019 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber
        fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have
        the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.

002:020 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken
        away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

002:021 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment:
        else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old,
        and the rent is made worse.

002:022 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new
        wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the
        bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new
        bottles.

002:023 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on
        the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to
        pluck the ears of corn.

002:024 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the
        sabbath day that which is not lawful?

002:025 And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when
        he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with
        him?

002:026 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the
        high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to
        eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with
        him?

002:027 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not
        man for the sabbath:

002:028 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

003:001 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man
        there which had a withered hand.

003:002 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath
        day; that they might accuse him.

003:003 And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand
        forth.

003:004 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath
        days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held
        their peace.

003:005 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being
        grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the
        man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and
        his hand was restored whole as the other.

003:006 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel
        with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

003:007 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and
        a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,

003:008 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan;
        and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they
        had heard what great things he did, came unto him.

003:009 And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait
        on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.

003:010 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him
        for to touch him, as many as had plagues.

003:011 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him,
        and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.

003:012 And he straitly charged them that they should not make him
        known.

003:013 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he
        would: and they came unto him.

003:014 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that
        he might send them forth to preach,

003:015 And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:

003:016 And Simon he surnamed Peter;

003:017 And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James;
        and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:

003:018 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and
        Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and
        Simon the Canaanite,

003:019 And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went
        into an house.

003:020 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could
        not so much as eat bread.

003:021 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on
        him: for they said, He is beside himself.

003:022 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
        Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out
        devils.

003:023 And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables,
        How can Satan cast out Satan?

003:024 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom
        cannot stand.

003:025 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot
        stand.

003:026 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he
        cannot stand, but hath an end.

003:027 No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his
        goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he
        will spoil his house.

003:028 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the
        sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall
        blaspheme:

003:029 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never
        forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.

003:030 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.

003:031 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing
        without, sent unto him, calling him.

003:032 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him,
        Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.

003:033 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my
        brethren?

003:034 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and
        said, Behold my mother and my brethren!

003:035 For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my
        brother, and my sister, and mother.

004:001 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was
        gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a
        ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the
        sea on the land.

004:002 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them
        in his doctrine,

004:003 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:

004:004 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side,
        and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.

004:005 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth;
        and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of
        earth:

004:006 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had
        no root, it withered away.

004:007 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked
        it, and it yielded no fruit.

004:008 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang
        up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some
        sixty, and some an hundred.

004:009 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him
        hear.

004:010 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the
        twelve asked of him the parable.

004:011 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the
        mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without,
        all these things are done in parables:

004:012 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they
        may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be
        converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.

004:013 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then
        will ye know all parables?

004:014 The sower soweth the word.

004:015 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown;
        but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh
        away the word that was sown in their hearts.

004:016 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground;
        who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it
        with gladness;

004:017 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
        afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the
        word's sake, immediately they are offended.

004:018 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear
        the word,

004:019 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,
        and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and
        it becometh unfruitful.

004:020 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear
        the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some
        thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.

004:021 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a
        bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?

004:022 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested;
        neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come
        abroad.

004:023 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

004:024 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what
        measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you
        that hear shall more be given.

004:025 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not,
        from him shall be taken even that which he hath.

004:026 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
        seed into the ground;

004:027 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should
        spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.

004:028 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the
        blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.

004:029 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in
        the sickle, because the harvest is come.

004:030 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or
        with what comparison shall we compare it?

004:031 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in
        the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:

004:032 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than
        all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls
        of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.

004:033 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as
        they were able to hear it.

004:034 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they
        were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.

004:035 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them,
        Let us pass over unto the other side.

004:036 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even
        as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other
        little ships.

004:037 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into
        the ship, so that it was now full.

004:038 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow:
        and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not
        that we perish?

004:039 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea,
        Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great
        calm.

004:040 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that
        ye have no faith?

004:041 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What
        manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey
        him?

005:001 And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the
        country of the Gadarenes.

005:002 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met
        him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,

005:003 Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind
        him, no, not with chains:

005:004 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains,
        and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the
        fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.

005:005 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the
        tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.

005:006 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,

005:007 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with
        thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by
        God, that thou torment me not.

005:008 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean
        spirit.

005:009 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying,
        My name is Legion: for we are many.

005:010 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out
        of the country.

005:011 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of
        swine feeding.

005:012 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the
        swine, that we may enter into them.

005:013 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits
        went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran
        violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about
        two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.

005:014 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and
        in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was
        done.

005:015 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with
        the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in
        his right mind: and they were afraid.

005:016 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
        possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.

005:017 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.

005:018 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed
        with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.

005:019 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to
        thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done
        for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.

005:020 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great
        things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.

005:021 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other
        side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the
        sea.

005:022 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,
        Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,

005:023 And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at
        the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on
        her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.

005:024 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and
        thronged him.

005:025 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,

005:026 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent
        all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew
        worse,

005:027 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and
        touched his garment.

005:028 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be
        whole.

005:029 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and
        she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.

005:030 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone
        out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who
        touched my clothes?

005:031 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude
        thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

005:032 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.

005:033 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in
        her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the
        truth.

005:034 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee
        whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.

005:035 While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the
        synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead:
        why troublest thou the Master any further?

005:036 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto
        the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.

005:037 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James,
        and John the brother of James.

005:038 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and
        seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.

005:039 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this
        ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.

005:040 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all
        out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and
        them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was
        lying.

005:041 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha
        cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee,
        arise.

005:042 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of
        the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great
        astonishment.

005:043 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and
        commanded that something should be given her to eat.

006:001 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country;
        and his disciples follow him.

006:002 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the
        synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From
        whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this
        which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are
        wrought by his hands?

006:003 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of
        James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his
        sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.

006:004 But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour,
        but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own
        house.

006:005 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his
        hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.

006:006 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round
        about the villages, teaching.

006:007 And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them
        forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean
        spirits;

006:008 And commanded them that they should take nothing for their
        journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in
        their purse:

006:009 But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.

006:010 And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an
        house, there abide till ye depart from that place.

006:011 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye
        depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a
        testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be
        more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment,
        than for that city.

006:012 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.

006:013 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that
        were sick, and healed them.

006:014 And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:)
        and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead,
        and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.

006:015 Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a
        prophet, or as one of the prophets.

006:016 But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I
        beheaded: he is risen from the dead.

006:017 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and
        bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's
        wife: for he had married her.

006:018 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to
        have thy brother's wife.

006:019 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have
        killed him; but she could not:

006:020 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an
        holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many
        things, and heard him gladly.

006:021 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday
        made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates
        of Galilee;

006:022 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and
        danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king
        said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I
        will give it thee.

006:023 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will
        give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.

006:024 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I
        ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.

006:025 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and
        asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger
        the head of John the Baptist.

006:026 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and
        for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.

006:027 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded
        his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the
        prison,

006:028 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel:
        and the damsel gave it to her mother.

006:029 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his
        corpse, and laid it in a tomb.

006:030 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and
        told him all things, both what they had done, and what they
        had taught.

006:031 And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
        place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going,
        and they had no leisure so much as to eat.

006:032 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.

006:033 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran
        afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came
        together unto him.

006:034 And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved
        with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not
        having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.

006:035 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto
        him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far
        passed:

006:036 Send them away, that they may go into the country round about,
        and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have
        nothing to eat.

006:037 He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they
        say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of
        bread, and give them to eat?

006:038 He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And
        when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.

006:039 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon
        the green grass.

006:040 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.

006:041 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he
        looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and
        gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two
        fishes divided he among them all.

006:042 And they did all eat, and were filled.

006:043 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of
        the fishes.

006:044 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand
        men.

006:045 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the
        ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while
        he sent away the people.

006:046 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to
        pray.

006:047 And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea,
        and he alone on the land.

006:048 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary
        unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh
        unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by
        them.

006:049 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it
        had been a spirit, and cried out:

006:050 For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he
        talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is
        I; be not afraid.

006:051 And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased:
        and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and
        wondered.

006:052 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their
        heart was hardened.

006:053 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of
        Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.

006:054 And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew
        him,

006:055 And ran through that whole region round about, and began to
        carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he
        was.

006:056 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or
        country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him
        that they might touch if it were but the border of his
        garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.

007:001 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the
        scribes, which came from Jerusalem.

007:002 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with
        defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found
        fault.

007:003 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their
        hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.

007:004 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat
        not. And many other things there be, which they have received
        to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and
        of tables.

007:005 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy
        disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat
        bread with unwashen hands?

007:006 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of
        you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me
        with their lips, but their heart is far from me.

007:007 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
        commandments of men.

007:008 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition
        of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such
        like things ye do.

007:009 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of
        God, that ye may keep your own tradition.

007:010 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso
        curseth father or mother, let him die the death:

007:011 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is
        Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be
        profited by me; he shall be free.

007:012 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
        mother;

007:013 Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition,
        which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.

007:014 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto
        them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:

007:015 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him
        can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those
        are they that defile the man.

007:016 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

007:017 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his
        disciples asked him concerning the parable.

007:018 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also?
        Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without
        entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;

007:019 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly,
        and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?

007:020 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth
        the man.

007:021 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil
        thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,

007:022 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an
        evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:

007:023 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.

007:024 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre
        and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man
        know it: but he could not be hid.

007:025 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean
        spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:

007:026 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she
        besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her
        daughter.

007:027 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for
        it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it
        unto the dogs.

007:028 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs
        under the table eat of the children's crumbs.

007:029 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is
        gone out of thy daughter.

007:030 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone
        out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.

007:031 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he
        came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts
        of Decapolis.

007:032 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an
        impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand
        upon him.

007:033 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers
        into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;

007:034 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him,
        Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.

007:035 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his
        tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.

007:036 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more
        he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published
        it;

007:037 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all
        things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to
        speak.

008:001 In those days the multitude being very great, and having
        nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith
        unto them,

008:002 I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been
        with me three days, and have nothing to eat:

008:003 And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will
        faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.

008:004 And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy
        these men with bread here in the wilderness?

008:005 And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said,
        Seven.

008:006 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he
        took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to
        his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before
        the people.

008:007 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded
        to set them also before them.

008:008 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
        broken meat that was left seven baskets.

008:009 And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent
        them away.

008:010 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and
        came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

008:011 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him,
        seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.

008:012 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
        generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There
        shall no sign be given unto this generation.

008:013 And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to
        the other side.

008:014 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had
        they in the ship with them more than one loaf.

008:015 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven
        of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.

008:016 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we
        have no bread.

008:017 And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye,
        because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither
        understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?

008:018 Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do
        ye not remember?

008:019 When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many
        baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him,
        Twelve.

008:020 And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full
        of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.

008:021 And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?

008:022 And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto
        him, and besought him to touch him.

008:023 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the
        town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon
        him, he asked him if he saw ought.

008:024 And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.

008:025 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him
        look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.

008:026 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the
        town, nor tell it to any in the town.

008:027 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of
        Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples,
        saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?

008:028 And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and
        others, One of the prophets.

008:029 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
        answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.

008:030 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.

008:031 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer
        many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief
        priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise
        again.

008:032 And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began
        to rebuke him.

008:033 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he
        rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou
        savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that
        be of men.

008:034 And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples
        also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him
        deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

008:035 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever
        shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same
        shall save it.

008:036 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole
        world, and lose his own soul?

008:037 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

008:038 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in
        this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the
        Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his
        Father with the holy angels.

009:001 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be
        some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death,
        till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.

009:002 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and
        John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by
        themselves: and he was transfigured before them.

009:003 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as
        no fuller on earth can white them.

009:004 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were
        talking with Jesus.

009:005 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for
        us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for
        thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

009:006 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.

009:007 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came
        out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.

009:008 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no
        man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.

009:009 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that
        they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the
        Son of man were risen from the dead.

009:010 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one
        with another what the rising from the dead should mean.

009:011 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias
        must first come?

009:012 And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and
        restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man,
        that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.

009:013 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have
        done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.

009:014 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude
        about them, and the scribes questioning with them.

009:015 And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were
        greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.

009:016 And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?

009:017 And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have
        brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;

009:018 And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth,
        and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to
        thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could
        not.

009:019 He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long
        shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him
        unto me.

009:020 And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him,
        straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground,
        and wallowed foaming.

009:021 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came
        unto him? And he said, Of a child.

009:022 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the
        waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have
        compassion on us, and help us.

009:023 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are
        possible to him that believeth.

009:024 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said
        with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

009:025 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he
        rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf
        spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into
        him.

009:026 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him:
        and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.

009:027 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he
        arose.

009:028 And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
        privately, Why could not we cast him out?

009:029 And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing,
        but by prayer and fasting.

009:030 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he
        would not that any man should know it.

009:031 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of
        man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill
        him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.

009:032 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask
        him.

009:033 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked
        them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the
        way?

009:034 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed
        among themselves, who should be the greatest.

009:035 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them,
        If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all,
        and servant of all.

009:036 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and
        when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,

009:037 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name,
        receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not
        me, but him that sent me.

009:038 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out
        devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad
        him, because he followeth not us.

009:039 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which
        shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of
        me.

009:040 For he that is not against us is on our part.

009:041 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my
        name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he
        shall not lose his reward.

009:042 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that
        believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were
        hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

009:043 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee
        to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into
        hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

009:044 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

009:045 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee
        to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into
        hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:

009:046 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

009:047 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for
        thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than
        having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:

009:048 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

009:049 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice
        shall be salted with salt.

009:050 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness,
        wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have
        peace one with another.

010:001 And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea
        by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him
        again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.

010:002 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for
        a man to put away his wife? tempting him.

010:003 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command
        you?

010:004 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement,
        and to put her away.

010:005 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of
        your heart he wrote you this precept.

010:006 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
        female.

010:007 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
        cleave to his wife;

010:008 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more
        twain, but one flesh.

010:009 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
        asunder.

010:010 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
        matter.

010:011 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
        marry another, committeth adultery against her.

010:012 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to
        another, she committeth adultery.

010:013 And they brought young children to him, that he should touch
        them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.

010:014 But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto
        them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid
        them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

010:015 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
        of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.

010:016 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and
        blessed them.

010:017 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one
        running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what
        shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?

010:018 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is
        none good but one, that is, God.

010:019 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
        kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not,
        Honour thy father and mother.

010:020 And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I
        observed from my youth.

010:021 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One
        thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and
        give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and
        come, take up the cross, and follow me.

010:022 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he
        had great possessions.

010:023 And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples,
        How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom
        of God!

010:024 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus
        answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it
        for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of
        God!

010:025 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,
        than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

010:026 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among
        themselves, Who then can be saved?

010:027 And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible,
        but not with God: for with God all things are possible.

010:028 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and
        have followed thee.

010:029 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is
        no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or
        father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my
        sake, and the gospel's,

010:030 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,
        and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and
        lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal
        life.

010:031 But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.

010:032 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went
        before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they
        were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell
        them what things should happen unto him,

010:033 Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man
        shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the
        scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall
        deliver him to the Gentiles:

010:034 And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit
        upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise
        again.

010:035 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him,
        saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us
        whatsoever we shall desire.

010:036 And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?

010:037 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy
        right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.

010:038 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye
        drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the
        baptism that I am baptized with?

010:039 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye
        shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the
        baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:

010:040 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to
        give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.

010:041 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased
        with James and John.

010:042 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know
        that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles
        exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise
        authority upon them.

010:043 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great
        among you, shall be your minister:

010:044 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of
        all.

010:045 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
        minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

010:046 And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with
        his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus,
        the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.

010:047 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to
        cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.

010:048 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he
        cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on
        me.

010:049 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And
        they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort,
        rise; he calleth thee.

010:050 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.

010:051 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I
        should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I
        might receive my sight.

010:052 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee
        whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed
        Jesus in the way.

011:001 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and
        Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his
        disciples,

011:002 And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against
        you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a
        colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.

011:003 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the
        Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him
        hither.

011:004 And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door
        without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.

011:005 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do
        ye, loosing the colt?

011:006 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they
        let them go.

011:007 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on
        him; and he sat upon him.

011:008 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down
        branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.

011:009 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried,
        saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
        Lord:

011:010 Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the
        name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.

011:011 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and
        when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the
        eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.

011:012 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was
        hungry:

011:013 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if
        haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it,
        he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.

011:014 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee
        hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.

011:015 And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple,
        and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple,
        and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats
        of them that sold doves;

011:016 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel
        through the temple.

011:017 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house
        shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye
        have made it a den of thieves.

011:018 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how
        they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the
        people was astonished at his doctrine.

011:019 And when even was come, he went out of the city.

011:020 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree
        dried up from the roots.

011:021 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master,
        behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.

011:022 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.

011:023 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
        mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and
        shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those
        things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have
        whatsoever he saith.

011:024 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when
        ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

011:025 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against
        any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you
        your trespasses.

011:026 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in
        heaven forgive your trespasses.

011:027 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the
        temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes,
        and the elders,

011:028 And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things?
        and who gave thee this authority to do these things?

011:029 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you
        one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what
        authority I do these things.

011:030 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.

011:031 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
        From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

011:032 But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all
        men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.

011:033 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And
        Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what
        authority I do these things.

012:001 And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man
        planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a
        place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to
        husbandmen, and went into a far country.

012:002 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he
        might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the
        vineyard.

012:003 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.

012:004 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they
        cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away
        shamefully handled.

012:005 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many
        others; beating some, and killing some.

012:006 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him
        also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.

012:007 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;
        come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.

012:008 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the
        vineyard.

012:009 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come
        and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto
        others.

012:010 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the
        builders rejected is become the head of the corner:

012:011 This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

012:012 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for
        they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and
        they left him, and went their way.

012:013 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
        Herodians, to catch him in his words.

012:014 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know
        that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest
        not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth:
        Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

012:015 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their
        hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny,
        that I may see it.

012:016 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this
        image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.

012:017 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the
        things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are
        God's. And they marvelled at him.

012:018 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
        resurrection; and they asked him, saying,

012:019 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave
        his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother
        should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

012:020 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and
        dying left no seed.

012:021 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed:
        and the third likewise.

012:022 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman
        died also.

012:023 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose
        wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.

012:024 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,
        because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?

012:025 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry,
        nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in
        heaven.

012:026 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in
        the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying,
        I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
        Jacob?

012:027 He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye
        therefore do greatly err.

012:028 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
        together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked
        him, Which is the first commandment of all?

012:029 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is,
        Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:

012:030 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
        with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
        strength: this is the first commandment.

012:031 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy
        neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater
        than these.

012:032 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
        truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:

012:033 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the
        understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the
        strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than
        all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

012:034 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto
        him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man
        after that durst ask him any question.

012:035 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple,
        How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?

012:036 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my
        Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy
        footstool.

012:037 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he
        then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.

012:038 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,
        which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the
        marketplaces,

012:039 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms
        at feasts:

012:040 Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long
        prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.

012:041 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the
        people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich
        cast in much.

012:042 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two
        mites, which make a farthing.

012:043 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
        Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in,
        than all they which have cast into the treasury:

012:044 For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her
        want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

013:001 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith
        unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings
        are here!

013:002 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great
        buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another,
        that shall not be thrown down.

013:003 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the
        temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him
        privately,

013:004 Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the
        sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?

013:005 And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man
        deceive you:

013:006 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
        deceive many.

013:007 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
        troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not
        be yet.

013:008 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
        kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and
        there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings
        of sorrows.

013:009 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to
        councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye
        shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a
        testimony against them.

013:010 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.

013:011 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no
        thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye
        premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour,
        that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy
        Ghost.

013:012 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the
        father the son; and children shall rise up against their
        parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.

013:013 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he
        that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

013:014 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
        by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him
        that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee
        to the mountains:

013:015 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the
        house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his
        house:

013:016 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to
        take up his garment.

013:017 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give
        suck in those days!

013:018 And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.

013:019 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from
        the beginning of the creation which God created unto this
        time, neither shall be.

013:020 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh
        should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath
        chosen, he hath shortened the days.

013:021 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,
        lo, he is there; believe him not:

013:022 For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall
        shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even
        the elect.

013:023 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.

013:024 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be
        darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,

013:025 And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in
        heaven shall be shaken.

013:026 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds
        with great power and glory.

013:027 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together
        his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the
        earth to the uttermost part of heaven.

013:028 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
        tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:

013:029 So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to
        pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.

013:030 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass,
        till all these things be done.

013:031 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
        away.

013:032 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the
        angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

013:033 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time
        is.

013:034 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left
        his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every
        man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.

013:035 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the
        house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing,
        or in the morning:

013:036 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

013:037 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

014:001 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of
        unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought
        how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.

014:002 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
        of the people.

014:003 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he
        sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of
        ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box,
        and poured it on his head.

014:004 And there were some that had indignation within themselves,
        and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?

014:005 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence,
        and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against
        her.

014:006 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath
        wrought a good work on me.

014:007 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will
        ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.

014:008 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint
        my body to the burying.

014:009 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
        preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath
        done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.

014:010 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
        priests, to betray him unto them.

014:011 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give
        him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

014:012 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
        passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we
        go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?

014:013 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto
        them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man
        bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.

014:014 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the
        house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I
        shall eat the passover with my disciples?

014:015 And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and
        prepared: there make ready for us.

014:016 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and
        found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the
        passover.

014:017 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.

014:018 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto
        you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.

014:019 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by
        one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?

014:020 And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve,
        that dippeth with me in the dish.

014:021 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe
        to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it
        for that man if he had never been born.

014:022 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake
        it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.

014:023 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it
        to them: and they all drank of it.

014:024 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,
        which is shed for many.

014:025 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of
        the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of
        God.

014:026 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount
        of Olives.

014:027 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
        me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd,
        and the sheep shall be scattered.

014:028 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

014:029 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
        will not I.

014:030 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this
        day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou
        shalt deny me thrice.

014:031 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I
        will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.

014:032 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he
        saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.

014:033 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to
        be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;

014:034 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto
        death: tarry ye here, and watch.

014:035 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and
        prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from
        him.

014:036 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;
        take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but
        what thou wilt.

014:037 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto
        Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?

014:038 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit
        truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.

014:039 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.

014:040 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their
        eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.

014:041 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on
        now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come;
        behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

014:042 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.

014:043 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the
        twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves,
        from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

014:044 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,
        Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead
        him away safely.

014:045 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and
        saith, Master, master; and kissed him.

014:046 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.

014:047 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a
        servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

014:048 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as
        against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?

014:049 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me
        not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.

014:050 And they all forsook him, and fled.

014:051 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen
        cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold
        on him:

014:052 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

014:053 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were
        assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the
        scribes.

014:054 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the
        high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself
        at the fire.

014:055 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
        against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.

014:056 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness
        agreed not together.

014:057 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,
        saying,

014:058 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with
        hands, and within three days I will build another made without
        hands.

014:059 But neither so did their witness agree together.

014:060 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
        saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness
        against thee?

014:061 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high
        priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the
        Son of the Blessed?

014:062 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting
        on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
        heaven.

014:063 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we
        any further witnesses?

014:064 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all
        condemned him to be guilty of death.

014:065 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to
        buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants
        did strike him with the palms of their hands.

014:066 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of
        the maids of the high priest:

014:067 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him,
        and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.

014:068 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what
        thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock
        crew.

014:069 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood
        by, This is one of them.

014:070 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by
        said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art
        a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.

014:071 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this
        man of whom ye speak.

014:072 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind
        the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice,
        thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he
        wept.

015:001 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
        consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole
        council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered
        him to Pilate.

015:002 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
        answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.

015:003 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he
        answered nothing.

015:004 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
        behold how many things they witness against thee.

015:005 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.

015:006 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner,
        whomsoever they desired.

015:007 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them
        that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder
        in the insurrection.

015:008 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he
        had ever done unto them.

015:009 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto
        you the King of the Jews?

015:010 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.

015:011 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather
        release Barabbas unto them.

015:012 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye
        then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the
        Jews?

015:013 And they cried out again, Crucify him.

015:014 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And
        they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.

015:015 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released
        Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged
        him, to be crucified.

015:016 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called
        Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.

015:017 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of
        thorns, and put it about his head,

015:018 And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!

015:019 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon
        him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.

015:020 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from
        him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to
        crucify him.

015:021 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming
        out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear
        his cross.

015:022 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
        interpreted, The place of a skull.

015:023 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he
        received it not.

015:024 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,
        casting lots upon them, what every man should take.

015:025 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

015:026 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE
        KING OF THE JEWS.

015:027 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right
        hand, and the other on his left.

015:028 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was
        numbered with the transgressors.

015:029 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,
        and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest
        it in three days,

015:030 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

015:031 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
        with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

015:032 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that
        we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him
        reviled him.

015:033 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the
        whole land until the ninth hour.

015:034 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
        Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My
        God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

015:035 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said,
        Behold, he calleth Elias.

015:036 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on
        a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see
        whether Elias will come to take him down.

015:037 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

015:038 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to
        the bottom.

015:039 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that
        he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this
        man was the Son of God.

015:040 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary
        Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses,
        and Salome;

015:041 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and
        ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with
        him unto Jerusalem.

015:042 And now when the even was come, because it was the
        preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,

015:043 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also
        waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto
        Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.

015:044 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto
        him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while
        dead.

015:045 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to
        Joseph.

015:046 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him
        in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out
        of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

015:047 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where
        he was laid.

016:001 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
        mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that
        they might come and anoint him.

016:002 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they
        came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.

016:003 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the
        stone from the door of the sepulchre?

016:004 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away:
        for it was very great.

016:005 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting
        on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they
        were affrighted.

016:006 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of
        Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here:
        behold the place where they laid him.

016:007 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth
        before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said
        unto you.

016:008 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for
        they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to
        any man; for they were afraid.

016:009 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he
        appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast
        seven devils.

016:010 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they
        mourned and wept.

016:011 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been
        seen of her, believed not.

016:012 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as
        they walked, and went into the country.

016:013 And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed
        they them.

016:014 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
        upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart,
        because they believed not them which had seen him after he was
        risen.

016:015 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach
        the gospel to every creature.

016:016 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
        believeth not shall be damned.

016:017 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name
        shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;

016:018 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly
        thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the
        sick, and they shall recover.

016:019 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received
        up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

016:020 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord
        working with them, and confirming the word with signs
        following. Amen.

Book 42	Luke

001:001 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
        declaration of those things which are most surely believed
        among us,

001:002 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning
        were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;

001:003 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of
        all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order,
        most excellent Theophilus,

001:004 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein
        thou hast been instructed.

001:005 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain
        priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife
        was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

001:006 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
        commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

001:007 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and
        they both were now well stricken in years.

001:008 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's
        office before God in the order of his course,

001:009 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to
        burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.

001:010 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at
        the time of incense.

001:011 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on
        the right side of the altar of incense.

001:012 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell
        upon him.

001:013 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy
        prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son,
        and thou shalt call his name John.

001:014 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
        at his birth.

001:015 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall
        drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled
        with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.

001:016 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
        their God.

001:017 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias,
        to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the
        disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people
        prepared for the Lord.

001:018 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this?
        for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.

001:019 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that
        stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee,
        and to shew thee these glad tidings.

001:020 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until
        the day that these things shall be performed, because thou
        believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their
        season.

001:021 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he
        tarried so long in the temple.

001:022 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
        perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he
        beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.

001:023 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his
        ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

001:024 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid
        herself five months, saying,

001:025 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked
        on me, to take away my reproach among men.

001:026 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God
        unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

001:027 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the
        house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

001:028 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art
        highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among
        women.

001:029 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast
        in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.

001:030 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast
        found favour with God.

001:031 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
        a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.

001:032 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:
        and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father
        David:

001:033 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of
        his kingdom there shall be no end.

001:034 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I
        know not a man?

001:035 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
        come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
        thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
        thee shall be called the Son of God.

001:036 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a
        son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who
        was called barren.

001:037 For with God nothing shall be impossible.

001:038 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
        according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

001:039 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country
        with haste, into a city of Juda;

001:040 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted
        Elisabeth.

001:041 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation
        of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled
        with the Holy Ghost:

001:042 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art
        thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

001:043 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should
        come to me?

001:044 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in
        mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

001:045 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a
        performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.

001:046 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,

001:047 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

001:048 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
        behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

001:049 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy
        is his name.

001:050 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
        generation.

001:051 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the
        proud in the imagination of their hearts.

001:052 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them
        of low degree.

001:053 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he
        hath sent empty away.

001:054 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his
        mercy;

001:055 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for
        ever.

001:056 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to
        her own house.

001:057 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered;
        and she brought forth a son.

001:058 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had
        shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

001:059 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to
        circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the
        name of his father.

001:060 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be
        called John.

001:061 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is
        called by this name.

001:062 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him
        called.

001:063 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name
        is John. And they marvelled all.

001:064 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed,
        and he spake, and praised God.

001:065 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all
        these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill
        country of Judaea.

001:066 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,
        saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of
        the Lord was with him.

001:067 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
        prophesied, saying,

001:068 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and
        redeemed his people,

001:069 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of
        his servant David;

001:070 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been
        since the world began:

001:071 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of
        all that hate us;

001:072 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember
        his holy covenant;

001:073 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,

001:074 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of
        the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,

001:075 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our
        life.

001:076 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:
        for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his
        ways;

001:077 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the
        remission of their sins,

001:078 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring
        from on high hath visited us,

001:079 To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow
        of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.

001:080 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the
        deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.

002:001 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a
        decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be
        taxed.

002:002 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of
        Syria.)

002:003 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.

002:004 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of
        Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called
        Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)

002:005 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with
        child.

002:006 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were
        accomplished that she should be delivered.

002:007 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
        swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was
        no room for them in the inn.

002:008 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
        field, keeping watch over their flock by night.

002:009 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory
        of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.

002:010 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring
        you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

002:011 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
        which is Christ the Lord.

002:012 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
        wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

002:013 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
        heavenly host praising God, and saying,

002:014 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
        toward men.

002:015 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them
        into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go
        even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,
        which the Lord hath made known unto us.

002:016 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the
        babe lying in a manger.

002:017 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying
        which was told them concerning this child.

002:018 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were
        told them by the shepherds.

002:019 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her
        heart.

002:020 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for
        all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told
        unto them.

002:021 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of
        the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of
        the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

002:022 And when the days of her purification according to the law of
        Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to
        present him to the Lord;

002:023 (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that
        openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)

002:024 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in
        the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young
        pigeons.

002:025 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was
        Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the
        consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.

002:026 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should
        not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

002:027 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the
        parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the
        custom of the law,

002:028 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,

002:029 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according
        to thy word:

002:030 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

002:031 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;

002:032 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people
        Israel.

002:033 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were
        spoken of him.

002:034 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother,
        Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of
        many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;

002:035 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that
        the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

002:036 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,
        of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived
        with an husband seven years from her virginity;

002:037 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which
        departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and
        prayers night and day.

002:038 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the
        Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption
        in Jerusalem.

002:039 And when they had performed all things according to the law of
        the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city
        Nazareth.

002:040 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
        wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.

002:041 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of
        the passover.

002:042 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
        after the custom of the feast.

002:043 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the
        child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his
        mother knew not of it.

002:044 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a
        day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and
        acquaintance.

002:045 And when they found him not, they turned back again to
        Jerusalem, seeking him.

002:046 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in
        the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing
        them, and asking them questions.

002:047 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding
        and answers.

002:048 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said
        unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy
        father and I have sought thee sorrowing.

002:049 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye
        not that I must be about my Father's business?

002:050 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.

002:051 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was
        subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in
        her heart.

002:052 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with
        God and man.

003:001 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
        Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being
        tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of
        Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the
        tetrarch of Abilene,

003:002 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God
        came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

003:003 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
        baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;

003:004 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the
        prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
        Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

003:005 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill
        shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight,
        and the rough ways shall be made smooth;

003:006 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

003:007 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized
        of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee
        from the wrath to come?

003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin
        not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father:
        for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise
        up children unto Abraham.

003:009 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every
        tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
        down, and cast into the fire.

003:010 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?

003:011 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let
        him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let
        him do likewise.

003:012 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
        Master, what shall we do?

003:013 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is
        appointed you.

003:014 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what
        shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man,
        neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.

003:015 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in
        their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;

003:016 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with
        water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose
        shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with
        the Holy Ghost and with fire:

003:017 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
        floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the
        chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.

003:018 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
        people.

003:019 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
        brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had
        done,

003:020 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.

003:021 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that
        Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,

003:022 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove
        upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art
        my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.

003:023 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being
        (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of
        Heli,

        which was the son of Cainan,

003:038 Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which
        was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.

004:001 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan,
        and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

004:002 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he
        did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward
        hungered.

004:003 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God,
        command this stone that it be made bread.

004:004 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall
        not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.

004:005 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed
        unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

004:006 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee,
        and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to
        whomsoever I will I give it.

004:007 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.

004:008 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me,
        Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
        and him only shalt thou serve.

004:009 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of
        the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast
        thyself down from hence:

004:010 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee,
        to keep thee:

004:011 And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time
        thou dash thy foot against a stone.

004:012 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not
        tempt the Lord thy God.

004:013 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed
        from him for a season.

004:014 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee:
        and there went out a fame of him through all the region round
        about.

004:015 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.

004:016 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as
        his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day,
        and stood up for to read.

004:017 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet
        Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place
        where it was written,

004:018 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me
        to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the
        brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
        recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that
        are bruised,

004:019 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

004:020 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister,
        and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the
        synagogue were fastened on him.

004:021 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture
        fulfilled in your ears.

004:022 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
        which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this
        Joseph's son?

004:023 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this
        proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard
        done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.

004:024 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in
        his own country.

004:025 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the
        days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six
        months, when great famine was throughout all the land;

004:026 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a
        city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.

004:027 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
        prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the
        Syrian.

004:028 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things,
        were filled with wrath,

004:029 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto
        the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they
        might cast him down headlong.

004:030 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,

004:031 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them
        on the sabbath days.

004:032 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was
        with power.

004:033 And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an
        unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,

004:034 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus
        of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou
        art; the Holy One of God.

004:035 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
        him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came
        out of him, and hurt him not.

004:036 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying,
        What a word is this! for with authority and power he
        commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.

004:037 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country
        round about.

004:038 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's
        house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever;
        and they besought him for her.

004:039 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her:
        and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.

004:040 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with
        divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands
        on every one of them, and healed them.

004:041 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou
        art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them
        not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.

004:042 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place:
        and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him,
        that he should not depart from them.

004:043 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to
        other cities also: for therefore am I sent.

004:044 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

005:001 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to
        hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,

005:002 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were
        gone out of them, and were washing their nets.

005:003 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and
        prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land.
        And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.

005:004 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out
        into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

005:005 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all
        the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I
        will let down the net.

005:006 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude
        of fishes: and their net brake.

005:007 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other
        ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and
        filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.

005:008 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,
        Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

005:009 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the
        draught of the fishes which they had taken:

005:010 And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which
        were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not;
        from henceforth thou shalt catch men.

005:011 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook
        all, and followed him.

005:012 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a
        man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and
        besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me
        clean.

005:013 And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be
        thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

005:014 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to
        the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses
        commanded, for a testimony unto them.

005:015 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and
        great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by
        him of their infirmities.

005:016 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.

005:017 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that
        there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which
        were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and
        Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

005:018 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a
        palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him
        before him.

005:019 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him
        in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and
        let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst
        before Jesus.

005:020 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins
        are forgiven thee.

005:021 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who
        is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but
        God alone?

005:022 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said
        unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?

005:023 Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to
        say, Rise up and walk?

005:024 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth
        to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say
        unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine
        house.

005:025 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that
        whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.

005:026 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were
        filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.

005:027 And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican,
        named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto
        him, Follow me.

005:028 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.

005:029 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there
        was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down
        with them.

005:030 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his
        disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and
        sinners?

005:031 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need
        not a physician; but they that are sick.

005:032 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

005:033 And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast
        often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the
        Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?

005:034 And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the
        bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

005:035 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken
        away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.

005:036 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece
        of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new
        maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new
        agreeth not with the old.

005:037 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new
        wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles
        shall perish.

005:038 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are
        preserved.

005:039 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new:
        for he saith, The old is better.

006:001 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first,
        that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples
        plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their
        hands.

006:002 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that
        which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?

006:003 And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as
        this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they
        which were with him;

006:004 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the
        shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it
        is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?

006:005 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the
        sabbath.

006:006 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered
        into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right
        hand was withered.

006:007 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would
        heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation
        against him.

006:008 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the
        withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he
        arose and stood forth.

006:009 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it
        lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save
        life, or to destroy it?

006:010 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man,
        Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was
        restored whole as the other.

006:011 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with
        another what they might do to Jesus.

006:012 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a
        mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

006:013 And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of
        them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;

006:014 Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother,
        James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,

006:015 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon
        called Zelotes,

006:016 And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also
        was the traitor.

006:017 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the
        company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out
        of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre
        and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their
        diseases;

006:018 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were
        healed.

006:019 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went
        virtue out of him, and healed them all.

006:020 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed
        be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

006:021 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled.
        Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.

006:022 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
        separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and
        cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

006:023 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your
        reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their
        fathers unto the prophets.

006:024 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
        consolation.

006:025 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you
        that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

006:026 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
        their fathers to the false prophets.

006:027 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to
        them which hate you,

006:028 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which
        despitefully use you.

006:029 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
        other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take
        thy coat also.

006:030 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh
        away thy goods ask them not again.

006:031 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
        likewise.

006:032 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for
        sinners also love those that love them.

006:033 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank
        have ye? for sinners also do even the same.

006:034 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank
        have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much
        again.

006:035 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for
        nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be
        the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the
        unthankful and to the evil.

006:036 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

006:037 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye
        shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:

006:038 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed
        down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give
        into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal
        it shall be measured to you again.

006:039 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the
        blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?

006:040 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is
        perfect shall be as his master.

006:041 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
        but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

006:042 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull
        out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest
        not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast
        out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou
        see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.

006:043 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth
        a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

006:044 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do
        not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.

006:045 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth
        forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil
        treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for
        of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.

006:046 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
        say?

006:047 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth
        them, I will shew you to whom he is like:

006:048 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and
        laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the
        stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake
        it: for it was founded upon a rock.

006:049 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without
        a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the
        stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the
        ruin of that house was great.

007:001 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the
        people, he entered into Capernaum.

007:002 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was
        sick, and ready to die.

007:003 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the
        Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.

007:004 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly,
        saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:

007:005 For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.

007:006 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from
        the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him,
        Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou
        shouldest enter under my roof:

007:007 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee:
        but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

007:008 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me
        soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to
        another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and
        he doeth it.

007:009 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned
        him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say
        unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

007:010 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the
        servant whole that had been sick.

007:011 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city
        called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much
        people.

007:012 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there
        was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and
        she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.

007:013 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
        unto her, Weep not.

007:014 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood
        still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.

007:015 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he
        delivered him to his mother.

007:016 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,
        That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath
        visited his people.

007:017 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and
        throughout all the region round about.

007:018 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.

007:019 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to
        Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for
        another?

007:020 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath
        sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or
        look we for another?

007:021 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and
        plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he
        gave sight.

007:022 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell
        John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind
        see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,
        the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.

007:023 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

007:024 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to
        speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into
        the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?

007:025 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
        raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and
        live delicately, are in kings' courts.

007:026 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto
        you, and much more than a prophet.

007:027 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
        before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

007:028 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there
        is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is
        least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.

007:029 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans,
        justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

007:030 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God
        against themselves, being not baptized of him.

007:031 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of
        this generation? and to what are they like?

007:032 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and
        calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you,
        and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have
        not wept.

007:033 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking
        wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.

007:034 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold
        a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and
        sinners!

007:035 But wisdom is justified of all her children.

007:036 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with
        him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to
        meat.

007:037 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she
        knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought
        an alabaster box of ointment,

007:038 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash
        his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her
        head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the
        ointment.

007:039 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake
        within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would
        have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth
        him: for she is a sinner.

007:040 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to
        say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.

007:041 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one
        owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.

007:042 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them
        both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?

007:043 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave
        most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.

007:044 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou
        this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no
        water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and
        wiped them with the hairs of her head.

007:045 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came
        in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

007:046 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath
        anointed my feet with ointment.

007:047 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are
        forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,
        the same loveth little.

007:048 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.

007:049 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within
        themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

007:050 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
        peace.

008:001 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every
        city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of
        the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,

008:002 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and
        infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven
        devils,

008:003 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and
        many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.

008:004 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to
        him out of every city, he spake by a parable:

008:005 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell
        by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the
        air devoured it.

008:006 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it
        withered away, because it lacked moisture.

008:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it,
        and choked it.

008:008 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit
        an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried,
        He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

008:009 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable
        be?

008:010 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
        kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they
        might not see, and hearing they might not understand.

008:011 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

008:012 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the
        devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they
        should believe and be saved.

008:013 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the
        word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while
        believe, and in time of temptation fall away.

008:014 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they
        have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and
        pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

008:015 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and
        good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth
        fruit with patience.

008:016 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a
        vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a
        candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.

008:017 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest;
        neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come
        abroad.

008:018 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him
        shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be
        taken even that which he seemeth to have.

008:019 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not
        come at him for the press.

008:020 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy
        brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.

008:021 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren
        are these which hear the word of God, and do it.

008:022 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship
        with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto
        the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.

008:023 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm
        of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were
        in jeopardy.

008:024 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master,
        we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging
        of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.

008:025 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being
        afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is
        this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they
        obey him.

008:026 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is
        over against Galilee.

008:027 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city
        a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no
        clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.

008:028 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and
        with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,
        thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.

008:029 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the
        man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound
        with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was
        driven of the devil into the wilderness.)

008:030 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said,
        Legion: because many devils were entered into him.

008:031 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out
        into the deep.

008:032 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the
        mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to
        enter into them. And he suffered them.

008:033 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the
        swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the
        lake, and were choked.

008:034 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went
        and told it in the city and in the country.

008:035 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus,
        and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed,
        sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind:
        and they were afraid.

008:036 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was
        possessed of the devils was healed.

008:037 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round
        about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken
        with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned
        back again.

008:038 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him
        that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,

008:039 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath
        done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout
        the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.

008:040 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people
        gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.

008:041 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler
        of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and
        besought him that he would come into his house:

008:042 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and
        she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.

008:043 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had
        spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed
        of any,

008:044 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and
        immediately her issue of blood stanched.

008:045 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and
        they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng
        thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

008:046 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that
        virtue is gone out of me.

008:047 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came
        trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him
        before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and
        how she was healed immediately.

008:048 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith
        hath made thee whole; go in peace.

008:049 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the
        synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead;
        trouble not the Master.

008:050 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not:
        believe only, and she shall be made whole.

008:051 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in,
        save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother
        of the maiden.

008:052 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is
        not dead, but sleepeth.

008:053 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

008:054 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,
        saying, Maid, arise.

008:055 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he
        commanded to give her meat.

008:056 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they
        should tell no man what was done.

009:001 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them
        power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.

009:002 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the
        sick.

009:003 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither
        staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have
        two coats apiece.

009:004 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence
        depart.

009:005 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that
        city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony
        against them.

009:006 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the
        gospel, and healing every where.

009:007 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and
        he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John
        was risen from the dead;

009:008 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one
        of the old prophets was risen again.

009:009 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom
        I hear such things? And he desired to see him.

009:010 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that
        they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into
        a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

009:011 And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he
        received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and
        healed them that had need of healing.

009:012 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and
        said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into
        the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get
        victuals: for we are here in a desert place.

009:013 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We
        have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should
        go and buy meat for all this people.

009:014 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his
        disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.

009:015 And they did so, and made them all sit down.

009:016 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking
        up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the
        disciples to set before the multitude.

009:017 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up
        of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.

009:018 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples
        were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people
        that I am?

009:019 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias;
        and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.

009:020 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering
        said, The Christ of God.

009:021 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no
        man that thing;

009:022 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be
        rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be
        slain, and be raised the third day.

009:023 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let
        him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

009:024 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever
        will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.

009:025 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and
        lose himself, or be cast away?

009:026 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him
        shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own
        glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.

009:027 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which
        shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.

009:028 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings,
        he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain
        to pray.

009:029 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered,
        and his raiment was white and glistering.

009:030 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses
        and Elias:

009:031 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he
        should accomplish at Jerusalem.

009:032 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep:
        and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men
        that stood with him.

009:033 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said
        unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us
        make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and
        one for Elias: not knowing what he said.

009:034 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed
        them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.

009:035 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my
        beloved Son: hear him.

009:036 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they
        kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those
        things which they had seen.

009:037 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come
        down from the hill, much people met him.

009:038 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I
        beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.

009:039 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and
        it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly
        departeth from him.

009:040 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could
        not.

009:041 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,
        how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son
        hither.

009:042 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare
        him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the
        child, and delivered him again to his father.

009:043 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while
        they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said
        unto his disciples,

009:044 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man
        shall be delivered into the hands of men.

009:045 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,
        that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that
        saying.

009:046 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should
        be greatest.

009:047 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a
        child, and set him by him,

009:048 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my
        name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth
        him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same
        shall be great.

009:049 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out
        devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth
        not with us.

009:050 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not
        against us is for us.

009:051 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be
        received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,

009:052 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and
        entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for
        him.

009:053 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though
        he would go to Jerusalem.

009:054 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said,
        Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven,
        and consume them, even as Elias did?

009:055 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what
        manner of spirit ye are of.

009:056 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to
        save them. And they went to another village.

009:057 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain
        man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou
        goest.

009:058 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the
        air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his
        head.

009:059 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer
        me first to go and bury my father.

009:060 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou
        and preach the kingdom of God.

009:061 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me
        first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.

009:062 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the
        plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

010:001 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and
        sent them two and two before his face into every city and
        place, whither he himself would come.

010:002 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but
        the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the
        harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.

010:003 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.

010:004 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man
        by the way.

010:005 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to
        this house.

010:006 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon
        it: if not, it shall turn to you again.

010:007 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things
        as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not
        from house to house.

010:008 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat
        such things as are set before you:

010:009 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The
        kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

010:010 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not,
        go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,

010:011 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do
        wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that
        the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.

010:012 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that
        day for Sodom, than for that city.

010:013 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
        mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been
        done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in
        sackcloth and ashes.

010:014 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the
        judgment, than for you.

010:015 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be
        thrust down to hell.

010:016 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you
        despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent
        me.

010:017 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even
        the devils are subject unto us through thy name.

010:018 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
        heaven.

010:019 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and
        scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing
        shall by any means hurt you.

010:020 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
        subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are
        written in heaven.

010:021 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee,
        O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these
        things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
        babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.

010:022 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man
        knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is,
        but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.

010:023 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,
        Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:

010:024 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to
        see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to
        hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

010:025 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him,
        saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

010:026 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest
        thou?

010:027 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
        all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
        strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

010:028 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and
        thou shalt live.

010:029 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who
        is my neighbour?

010:030 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from
        Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped
        him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him
        half dead.

010:031 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and
        when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.

010:032 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and
        looked on him, and passed by on the other side.

010:033 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was:
        and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,

010:034 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and
        wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn,
        and took care of him.

010:035 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
        gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him;
        and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will
        repay thee.

010:036 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto
        him that fell among the thieves?

010:037 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto
        him, Go, and do thou likewise.

010:038 Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a
        certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him
        into her house.

010:039 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus'
        feet, and heard his word.

010:040 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him,
        and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me
        to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.

010:041 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art
        careful and troubled about many things:

010:042 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part,
        which shall not be taken away from her.

011:001 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain
        place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him,
        Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.

011:002 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art
        in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
        done, as in heaven, so in earth.

011:003 Give us day by day our daily bread.

011:004 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is
        indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver
        us from evil.

011:005 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
        shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend
        me three loaves;

011:006 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have
        nothing to set before him?

011:007 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the
        door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot
        rise and give thee.

011:008 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because
        he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise
        and give him as many as he needeth.

011:009 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and
        ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

011:010 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
        findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

011:011 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will
        he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish
        give him a serpent?

011:012 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?

011:013 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
        children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the
        Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

011:014 And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came
        to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the
        people wondered.

011:015 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub
        the chief of the devils.

011:016 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.

011:017 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
        divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house
        divided against a house falleth.

011:018 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his
        kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through
        Beelzebub.

011:019 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons
        cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.

011:020 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the
        kingdom of God is come upon you.

011:021 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in
        peace:

011:022 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome
        him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and
        divideth his spoils.

011:023 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth
        not with me scattereth.

011:024 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
        through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith,
        I will return unto my house whence I came out.

011:025 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.

011:026 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more
        wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and
        the last state of that man is worse than the first.

011:027 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman
        of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed
        is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast
        sucked.

011:028 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word
        of God, and keep it.

011:029 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to
        say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there
        shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.

011:030 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the
        Son of man be to this generation.

011:031 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the
        men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from
        the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
        and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

011:032 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this
        generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the
        preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

011:033 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret
        place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they
        which come in may see the light.

011:034 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is
        single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine
        eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.

011:035 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not
        darkness.

011:036 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part
        dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright
        shining of a candle doth give thee light.

011:037 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with
        him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.

011:038 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not
        first washed before dinner.

011:039 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the
        outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is
        full of ravening and wickedness.

011:040 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that
        which is within also?

011:041 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold,
        all things are clean unto you.

011:042 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all
        manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God:
        these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
        undone.

011:043 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in
        the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

011:044 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as
        graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are
        not aware of them.

011:045 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,
        thus saying thou reproachest us also.

011:046 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men
        with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not
        the burdens with one of your fingers.

011:047 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and
        your fathers killed them.

011:048 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers:
        for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.

011:049 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them
        prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and
        persecute:

011:050 That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the
        foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

011:051 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which
        perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto
        you, It shall be required of this generation.

011:052 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of
        knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were
        entering in ye hindered.

011:053 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the
        Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to
        speak of many things:

011:054 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his
        mouth, that they might accuse him.

012:001 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an
        innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one
        upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all,
        Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

012:002 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed;
        neither hid, that shall not be known.

012:003 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard
        in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in
        closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.

012:004 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill
        the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

012:005 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which
        after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say
        unto you, Fear him.

012:006 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of
        them is forgotten before God?

012:007 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear
        not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.

012:008 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men,
        him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of
        God:

012:009 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the
        angels of God.

012:010 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it
        shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against
        the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.

012:011 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto
        magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing
        ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:

012:012 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye
        ought to say.

012:013 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my
        brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.

012:014 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider
        over you?

012:015 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness:
        for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things
        which he possesseth.

012:016 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a
        certain rich man brought forth plentifully:

012:017 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do,
        because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?

012:018 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and
        build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my
        goods.

012:019 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up
        for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

012:020 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be
        required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou
        hast provided?

012:021 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich
        toward God.

012:022 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take
        no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the
        body, what ye shall put on.

012:023 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.

012:024 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
        neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how
        much more are ye better than the fowls?

012:025 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature
        one cubit?

012:026 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why
        take ye thought for the rest?

012:027 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin
        not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was
        not arrayed like one of these.

012:028 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field,
        and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he
        clothe you, O ye of little faith?

012:029 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,
        neither be ye of doubtful mind.

012:030 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after:
        and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.

012:031 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things
        shall be added unto you.

012:032 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure
        to give you the kingdom.

012:033 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags
        which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not,
        where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.

012:034 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

012:035 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;

012:036 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when
        he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and
        knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.

012:037 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall
        find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird
        himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come
        forth and serve them.

012:038 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
        watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

012:039 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what
        hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have
        suffered his house to be broken through.

012:040 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an
        hour when ye think not.

012:041 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable
        unto us, or even to all?

012:042 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward,
        whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give
        them their portion of meat in due season?

012:043 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall
        find so doing.

012:044 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over
        all that he hath.

012:045 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his
        coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens,
        and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;

012:046 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh
        not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut
        him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the
        unbelievers.

012:047 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not
        himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten
        with many stripes.

012:048 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,
        shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is
        given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have
        committed much, of him they will ask the more.

012:049 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be
        already kindled?

012:050 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I
        straitened till it be accomplished!

012:051 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you,
        Nay; but rather division:

012:052 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,
        three against two, and two against three.

012:053 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son
        against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the
        daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her
        daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in
        law.

012:054 And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out
        of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so
        it is.

012:055 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be
        heat; and it cometh to pass.

012:056 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the
        earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?

012:057 Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?

012:058 When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as
        thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be
        delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the
        judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee
        into prison.

012:059 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid
        the very last mite.

013:001 There were present at that season some that told him of the
        Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their
        sacrifices.

013:002 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these
        Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they
        suffered such things?

013:003 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
        perish.

013:004 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and
        slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that
        dwelt in Jerusalem?

013:005 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
        perish.

013:006 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree
        planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon,
        and found none.

013:007 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these
        three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find
        none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?

013:008 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year
        also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:

013:009 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou
        shalt cut it down.

013:010 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

013:011 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
        eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise
        lift up herself.

013:012 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto
        her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.

013:013 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made
        straight, and glorified God.

013:014 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,
        because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said
        unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to
        work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the
        sabbath day.

013:015 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not
        each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from
        the stall, and lead him away to watering?

013:016 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom
        Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from
        this bond on the sabbath day?

013:017 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were
        ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious
        things that were done by him.

013:018 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and
        whereunto shall I resemble it?

013:019 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast
        into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the
        fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.

013:020 And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?

013:021 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three
        measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

013:022 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
        journeying toward Jerusalem.

013:023 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And
        he said unto them,

013:024 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto
        you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

013:025 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut
        to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at
        the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall
        answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:

013:026 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy
        presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.

013:027 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;
        depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.

013:028 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall
        see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in
        the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.

013:029 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from
        the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the
        kingdom of God.

013:030 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there
        are first which shall be last.

013:031 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto
        him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.

013:032 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I
        cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the
        third day I shall be perfected.

013:033 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day
        following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of
        Jerusalem.

013:034 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and
        stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have
        gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood
        under her wings, and ye would not!

013:035 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say
        unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye
        shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

014:001 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the
        chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they
        watched him.

014:002 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the
        dropsy.

014:003 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees,
        saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?

014:004 And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him,
        and let him go;

014:005 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or
        an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out
        on the sabbath day?

014:006 And they could not answer him again to these things.

014:007 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he
        marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.

014:008 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in
        the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be
        bidden of him;

014:009 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this
        man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.

014:010 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;
        that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee,
        Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the
        presence of them that sit at meat with thee.

014:011 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
        humbleth himself shall be exalted.

014:012 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a
        dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren,
        neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also
        bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.

014:013 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
        lame, the blind:

014:014 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee:
        for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.

014:015 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
        things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread
        in the kingdom of God.

014:016 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and
        bade many:

014:017 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were
        bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.

014:018 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first
        said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must
        needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.

014:019 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to
        prove them: I pray thee have me excused.

014:020 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I
        cannot come.

014:021 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then
        the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go
        out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring
        in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the
        blind.

014:022 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,
        and yet there is room.

014:023 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways
        and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be
        filled.

014:024 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden
        shall taste of my supper.

014:025 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and
        said unto them,

014:026 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother,
        and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and
        his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

014:027 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me,
        cannot be my disciple.

014:028 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
        first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to
        finish it?

014:029 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able
        to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,

014:030 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

014:031 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth
        not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten
        thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty
        thousand?

014:032 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an
        ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.

014:033 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all
        that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.

014:034 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
        shall it be seasoned?

014:035 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but
        men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

015:001 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to
        hear him.

015:002 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man
        receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.

015:003 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,

015:004 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of
        them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness,
        and go after that which is lost, until he find it?

015:005 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,
        rejoicing.

015:006 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
        neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have
        found my sheep which was lost.

015:007 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
        sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just
        persons, which need no repentance.

015:008 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one
        piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek
        diligently till she find it?

015:009 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her
        neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found
        the piece which I had lost.

015:010 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the
        angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.

015:011 And he said, A certain man had two sons:

015:012 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me
        the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto
        them his living.

015:013 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
        and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his
        substance with riotous living.

015:014 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that
        land; and he began to be in want.

015:015 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;
        and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

015:016 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that
        the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

015:017 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants
        of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish
        with hunger!

015:018 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,
        Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,

015:019 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of
        thy hired servants.

015:020 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
        great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and
        ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.

015:021 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against
        heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called
        thy son.

015:022 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best
        robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes
        on his feet:

015:023 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,
        and be merry:

015:024 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and
        is found. And they began to be merry.

015:025 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
        nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.

015:026 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
        meant.

015:027 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
        killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and
        sound.

015:028 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his
        father out, and intreated him.

015:029 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
        serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy
        commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might
        make merry with my friends:

015:030 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy
        living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.

015:031 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that
        I have is thine.

015:032 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this
        thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
        found.

016:001 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich
        man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him
        that he had wasted his goods.

016:002 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear
        this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou
        mayest be no longer steward.

016:003 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my
        lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg
        I am ashamed.

016:004 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the
        stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

016:005 So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and
        said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?

016:006 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him,
        Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

016:007 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said,
        An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy
        bill, and write fourscore.

016:008 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done
        wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation
        wiser than the children of light.

016:009 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon
        of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you
        into everlasting habitations.

016:010 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
        much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in
        much.

016:011 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
        mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?

016:012 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another
        man's, who shall give you that which is your own?

016:013 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the
        one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
        despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

016:014 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these
        things: and they derided him.

016:015 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves
        before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is
        highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.

016:016 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the
        kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.

016:017 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle
        of the law to fail.

016:018 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,
        committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put
        away from her husband committeth adultery.

016:019 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and
        fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:

016:020 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid
        at his gate, full of sores,

016:021 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the
        rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

016:022 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
        the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and
        was buried;

016:023 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
        Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

016:024 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
        send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,
        and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.

016:025 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
        receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things:
        but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

016:026 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
        fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;
        neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.

016:027 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou
        wouldest send him to my father's house:

016:028 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest
        they also come into this place of torment.

016:029 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let
        them hear them.

016:030 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them
        from the dead, they will repent.

016:031 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
        neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

017:001 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that
        offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!

017:002 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
        neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one
        of these little ones.

017:003 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee,
        rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.

017:004 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and
        seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent;
        thou shalt forgive him.

017:005 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

017:006 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed,
        ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by
        the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey
        you.

017:007 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,
        will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field,
        Go and sit down to meat?

017:008 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may
        sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and
        drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?

017:009 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were
        commanded him? I trow not.

017:010 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which
        are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have
        done that which was our duty to do.

017:011 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed
        through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

017:012 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten
        men that were lepers, which stood afar off:

017:013 And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have
        mercy on us.

017:014 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves
        unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went,
        they were cleansed.

017:015 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
        and with a loud voice glorified God,

017:016 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and
        he was a Samaritan.

017:017 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but
        where are the nine?

017:018 There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save
        this stranger.

017:019 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made
        thee whole.

017:020 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of
        God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God
        cometh not with observation:

017:021 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold,
        the kingdom of God is within you.

017:022 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye
        shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye
        shall not see it.

017:023 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not
        after them, nor follow them.

017:024 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part
        under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so
        shall also the Son of man be in his day.

017:025 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
        generation.

017:026 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
        days of the Son of man.

017:027 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given
        in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and
        the flood came, and destroyed them all.

017:028 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they
        drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;

017:029 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
        brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.

017:030 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is
        revealed.

017:031 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his
        stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and
        he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.

017:032 Remember Lot's wife.

017:033 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and
        whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.

017:034 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed;
        the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

017:035 Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,
        and the other left.

017:036 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
        other left.

017:037 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said
        unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be
        gathered together.

018:001 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
        always to pray, and not to faint;

018:002 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God,
        neither regarded man:

018:003 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him,
        saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.

018:004 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within
        himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;

018:005 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest
        by her continual coming she weary me.

018:006 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.

018:007 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and
        night unto him, though he bear long with them?

018:008 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless
        when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?

018:009 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in
        themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:

018:010 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee,
        and the other a publican.

018:011 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
        thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,
        adulterers, or even as this publican.

018:012 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

018:013 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much
        as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,
        God be merciful to me a sinner.

018:014 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
        than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be
        abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

018:015 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch
        them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

018:016 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little
        children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is
        the kingdom of God.

018:017 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
        of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.

018:018 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall
        I do to inherit eternal life?

018:019 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is
        good, save one, that is, God.

018:020 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
        kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy
        father and thy mother.

018:021 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.

018:022 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet
        lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and
        distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
        heaven: and come, follow me.

018:023 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very
        rich.

018:024 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How
        hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of
        God!

018:025 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye,
        than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

018:026 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?

018:027 And he said, The things which are impossible with men are
        possible with God.

018:028 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.

018:029 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man
        that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or
        children, for the kingdom of God's sake,

018:030 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and
        in the world to come life everlasting.

018:031 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold,
        we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the
        prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

018:032 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
        mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:

018:033 And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the
        third day he shall rise again.

018:034 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was
        hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

018:035 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
        certain blind man sat by the way side begging:

018:036 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.

018:037 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

018:038 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
        me.

018:039 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold
        his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David,
        have mercy on me.

018:040 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and
        when he was come near, he asked him,

018:041 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said,
        Lord, that I may receive my sight.

018:042 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath
        saved thee.

018:043 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
        glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave
        praise unto God.

019:001 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.

019:002 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the
        chief among the publicans, and he was rich.

019:003 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the
        press, because he was little of stature.

019:004 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
        him: for he was to pass that way.

019:005 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him,
        and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for
        to day I must abide at thy house.

019:006 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

019:007 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was
        gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.

019:008 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the
        half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any
        thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him
        fourfold.

019:009 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
        house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

019:010 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
        lost.

019:011 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
        because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought
        that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.

019:012 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country
        to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

019:013 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,
        and said unto them, Occupy till I come.

019:014 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,
        saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.

019:015 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having
        received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be
        called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might
        know how much every man had gained by trading.

019:016 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
        pounds.

019:017 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou
        hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over
        ten cities.

019:018 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
        pounds.

019:019 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.

019:020 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound,
        which I have kept laid up in a napkin:

019:021 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou
        takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou
        didst not sow.

019:022 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge
        thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere
        man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did
        not sow:

019:023 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at
        my coming I might have required mine own with usury?

019:024 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound,
        and give it to him that hath ten pounds.

019:025 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)

019:026 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be
        given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be
        taken away from him.

019:027 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign
        over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.

019:028 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to
        Jerusalem.

019:029 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
        Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two
        of his disciples,

019:030 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which
        at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never
        man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.

019:031 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say
        unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.

019:032 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he
        had said unto them.

019:033 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said
        unto them, Why loose ye the colt?

019:034 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.

019:035 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments
        upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.

019:036 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.

019:037 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the
        mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to
        rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty
        works that they had seen;

019:038 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the
        Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

019:039 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto
        him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.

019:040 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these
        should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

019:041 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over
        it,

019:042 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
        day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are
        hid from thine eyes.

019:043 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall
        cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep
        thee in on every side,

019:044 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children
        within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon
        another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

019:045 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that
        sold therein, and them that bought;

019:046 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of
        prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.

019:047 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and
        the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,

019:048 And could not find what they might do: for all the people were
        very attentive to hear him.

020:001 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught
        the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief
        priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,

020:002 And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest
        thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?

020:003 And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one
        thing; and answer me:

020:004 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?

020:005 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
        From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?

020:006 But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for
        they be persuaded that John was a prophet.

020:007 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.

020:008 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority
        I do these things.

020:009 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain
        man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and
        went into a far country for a long time.

020:010 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that
        they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the
        husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.

020:011 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and
        entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

020:012 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast
        him out.

020:013 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will
        send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when
        they see him.

020:014 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among
        themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him,
        that the inheritance may be ours.

020:015 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What
        therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?

020:016 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the
        vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God
        forbid.

020:017 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is
        written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is
        become the head of the corner?

020:018 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on
        whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

020:019 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to
        lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they
        perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.

020:020 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign
        themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words,
        that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of
        the governor.

020:021 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest
        and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of
        any, but teachest the way of God truly:

020:022 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?

020:023 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why
        tempt ye me?

020:024 Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They
        answered and said, Caesar's.

020:025 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things
        which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.

020:026 And they could not take hold of his words before the people:
        and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.

020:027 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that
        there is any resurrection; and they asked him,

020:028 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die,
        having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother
        should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

020:029 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a
        wife, and died without children.

020:030 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.

020:031 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and
        they left no children, and died.

020:032 Last of all the woman died also.

020:033 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for
        seven had her to wife.

020:034 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world
        marry, and are given in marriage:

020:035 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world,
        and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are
        given in marriage:

020:036 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the
        angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the
        resurrection.

020:037 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,
        when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of
        Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

020:038 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all
        live unto him.

020:039 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast
        well said.

020:040 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.

020:041 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's
        son?

020:042 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said
        unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

020:043 Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

020:044 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?

020:045 Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his
        disciples,

020:046 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and
        love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the
        synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;

020:047 Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers:
        the same shall receive greater damnation.

021:001 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts
        into the treasury.

021:002 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two
        mites.

021:003 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow
        hath cast in more than they all:

021:004 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the
        offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the
        living that she had.

021:005 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with
        goodly stones and gifts, he said,

021:006 As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in
        the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that
        shall not be thrown down.

021:007 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these
        things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall
        come to pass?

021:008 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall
        come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth
        near: go ye not therefore after them.

021:009 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not
        terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the
        end is not by and by.

021:010 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and
        kingdom against kingdom:

021:011 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines,
        and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall
        there be from heaven.

021:012 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and
        persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into
        prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's
        sake.

021:013 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.

021:014 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before
        what ye shall answer:

021:015 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your
        adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

021:016 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
        kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be
        put to death.

021:017 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.

021:018 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.

021:019 In your patience possess ye your souls.

021:020 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then
        know that the desolation thereof is nigh.

021:021 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and
        let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not
        them that are in the countries enter thereinto.

021:022 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
        written may be fulfilled.

021:023 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
        suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the
        land, and wrath upon this people.

021:024 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
        away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden
        down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be
        fulfilled.

021:025 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in
        the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with
        perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;

021:026 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after
        those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of
        heaven shall be shaken.

021:027 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
        power and great glory.

021:028 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
        lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.

021:029 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all
        the trees;

021:030 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves
        that summer is now nigh at hand.

021:031 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye
        that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.

021:032 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away,
        till all be fulfilled.

021:033 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
        away.

021:034 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
        overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of
        this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.

021:035 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the
        face of the whole earth.

021:036 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted
        worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and
        to stand before the Son of man.

021:037 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at
        night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the
        mount of Olives.

021:038 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the
        temple, for to hear him.

022:001 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called
        the Passover.

022:002 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill
        him; for they feared the people.

022:003 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
        number of the twelve.

022:004 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
        captains, how he might betray him unto them.

022:005 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.

022:006 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto
        them in the absence of the multitude.

022:007 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must
        be killed.

022:008 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the
        passover, that we may eat.

022:009 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?

022:010 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the
        city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water;
        follow him into the house where he entereth in.

022:011 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master
        saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat
        the passover with my disciples?

022:012 And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make
        ready.

022:013 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they
        made ready the passover.

022:014 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve
        apostles with him.

022:015 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this
        passover with you before I suffer:

022:016 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it
        be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

022:017 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and
        divide it among yourselves:

022:018 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine,
        until the kingdom of God shall come.

022:019 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave
        unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you:
        this do in remembrance of me.

022:020 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the
        new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.

022:021 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on
        the table.

022:022 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe
        unto that man by whom he is betrayed!

022:023 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it
        was that should do this thing.

022:024 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should
        be accounted the greatest.

022:025 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
        lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them
        are called benefactors.

022:026 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let
        him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth
        serve.

022:027 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that
        serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as
        he that serveth.

022:028 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.

022:029 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed
        unto me;

022:030 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit
        on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

022:031 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to
        have you, that he may sift you as wheat:

022:032 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when
        thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

022:033 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both
        into prison, and to death.

022:034 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this
        day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

022:035 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and
        scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.

022:036 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him
        take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword,
        let him sell his garment, and buy one.

022:037 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
        accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the
        transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.

022:038 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said
        unto them, It is enough.

022:039 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of
        Olives; and his disciples also followed him.

022:040 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye
        enter not into temptation.

022:041 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and
        kneeled down, and prayed,

022:042 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:
        nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

022:043 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven,
        strengthening him.

022:044 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat
        was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the
        ground.

022:045 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his
        disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,

022:046 And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter
        into temptation.

022:047 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was
        called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew
        near unto Jesus to kiss him.

022:048 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man
        with a kiss?

022:049 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they
        said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

022:050 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut
        off his right ear.

022:051 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he
        touched his ear, and healed him.

022:052 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the
